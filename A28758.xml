         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHereas in the firſt year of the late Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there was one Uniform Order of Common Service and Prayer, and of the Adminiſtration of Sacraments, Rites, and Ceremonies in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Word of God, and uſage of the primitive Church) Compiled by the Reverend Biſhops and Clergy, ſet forth in one Book, Entituled, <hi>The Book of Common Prayer, and Adminiſtration of Sacraments, and other Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies in the Church of</hi> England, and enjoyned to be uſed by Act of Parliament, holden in the ſaid Firſt year of the ſaid late Queen, Entituled, <hi>An Act for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity of Common Prayer, and Service in the Church, and Adminiſtration of the Sacraments,</hi> very comfortable to all good People, deſirous to live in Chriſtian Converſation, and moſt profitable to the eſtate of this Realm, upon the which the Mercy, Favour and Bleſſing of Almighty God is in no wiſe ſo readily and plentifully poured, as by Common Prayers, due uſ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT hath been the Wiſdom of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ever ſince the firſt compiling of her publick Liturgy, to keep the Mean between the two Extremes, of too much ſtiffneſs in refuſing, and of too much eaſineſs in admitting any variation from it. For, as on the one ſide common Experience ſheweth, that where a change hath been made of things adviſedly eſtabliſhed (no evident neceſſity ſo requiring) ſundry inconveniences have thereupon enſued; and thoſe many times more, and greater then the evils that were intended to be remedied by ſuch change: ſo on the other ſide, the particular Forms of Divine Worſhip, and the Rites and Ceremonies appointed to be uſed therein, being things in their own nature indifferent, and alterable, and ſo acknowledged; it is but reaſonable, that upon weighty and important conſiderations, according to the various exigency of times and occaſions, ſuch changes and alterations ſhould be made therein, as to thoſe that are in place of Authority ſhould from time to time ſeem either neceſſary or expedient. Accordingly we find, that in the Reigns of ſeveral Princes of bleſſed memory ſince the Reformation, the Church upon juſt and weighty conſiderations her thereunto moving, hath yielded to make ſuch Alterations in ſome particulars, as in their reſpective times were thought convenient: Yet ſo, as that the main Body and eſſentials of it (as well in the chiefeſt materials, as in the frame and order thereof) have ſtill continued the ſame unto this day, and do yet ſtand firm and unſhaken, notwithſtanding all the vain attempts and impetuous aſſaults made againſt it by ſuch men as are given to change, and have always diſcovered a greater regard to their own private Fancies and Intereſts, then to that duty they owe to the publick.</p>
            <p>By what undue means, and for what miſchievous purpoſes the uſe of the Liturgy (though enjoyned by the Laws of the Land, and thoſe Laws never yet repealed) came, during the late unhappy confuſions, to be diſcontinued, is too well known to the World, and we are not willing here to remember. But when, upon his Majeſties happy Reſtauration it ſeemed probable, that, amongſt other things, the uſe of the Liturgy alſo would return of courſe (the ſame having never been legally aboliſhed) unleſs ſome timely means were uſed to prevent it; thoſe men, Who under the late uſurped powers had made it a great part of their buſineſs to render the people diſaffected thereunto, ſaw themſelves in point of reputation and intereſt concerned (unleſs they would freely acknowledge themſelves to have erred, which ſuch men are very hardly brought to do) with their utmoſt endeavours to hinder the reſtitution thereof. In order whereunto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Pamphlets were publiſhed againſt the Book of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> the old Objections muſtered up, with the addition of ſome new ones more then formerly had been made, to make the number ſwell. In fine, great importunities were uſed to his ſacred Majeſty, that the ſaid Book might be reviſed, and ſuch Alterations therein, and Additions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto made, as ſhould be thought requiſite for the eaſe of tender Conſciences: Whereunto his Majeſty, out of his pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to give ſatisfaction (ſo far as could be reaſonably expected) to all his Subjects of what perſwaſion ſoever, did graciouſly condeſcend.</p>
            <p>In which Review we have endeavoured to obſerve the like Moderation, as we find to have been uſed in the like caſe in former times. And therefore of the ſundry Alterations propoſed unto us, we have rejected all ſuch as were either of dangerous conſequence (as ſecretly ſtriking at ſome eſtabliſhed Doctrine, or laudable Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or indeed of the whole Catholick Church of Chriſt) or elſe of no conſequence at all, but utterly frivolous and vain. But ſuch Alterations as were tendred to us (by what perſons, under what pretences, or to what purpoſe ſoever ſo tendred) as ſeemed to us in any degree requiſite or expedient, we have willingly, and of our own accord aſſented unto: Not enforced ſo to do by any ſtrength of Argument, convincing us of the neceſſity of making the ſaid Alterations: For we are fully perſwaded in our judgments (and we here profeſs it to the World) that the Book, as it ſtood before eſtabliſhed by Law, doth not contain in it any thing contrary to the Word of God, or to ſound Doctrine, or which a godly man may not with a good Conſcience uſe and ſubmit unto, or which is not fairly defenſible againſt any that ſhall oppoſe the ſame; if it ſhall be allowed ſuch juſt and favourable conſtruction as in common Equity ought to be allowed to all Humane Writings, eſpecially ſuch are ſet forth by Authority, and even to the very beſt Tranſlations of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Our general aim therefore in this Undertaking was, not to gratifie this or that Party, in any their unreaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; but to do that, which to our beſt underſtandings we conceived might moſt tend to the preſervation of peace and unity in the Church; the procuring of Reverence, and exciting of Piety and Devotion in the publick Worſhip of God; and the cutting off occaſion from them that ſeek occaſion of cavil, or quarrel againſt the Liturgy of the Church. And as to the ſeveral variations from the former Book, whether by Alteration, Addition, or otherwiſe, it ſhall ſuffice to give this general Account, That moſt of the Alterations were made, either firſt, for the better direction of them that are
<pb facs="tcp:48041:5"/> to officiate in any part of Divine Service; which is chiefly done in the Kalendars and Rubricks: Or ſecondly, for the more proper expreſſing of ſome words or phraſes of ancient uſage, in terms more ſuitable to the Language of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times, and the clearer explanation of ſome other words and phraſes, that were either of doubtful ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or otherwiſe liable to miſconſtruction: Or thirdly, for a more perfect rendring of ſuch portions of holy Scripture, as are inſerted into the Liturgy; which, in the Epiſtles and Goſpels eſpecially, and in ſundry other places, are now or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be read according to the laſt Tranſlation: and that it was thought convenient, that ſome Prayers and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, fitted to ſpecial Occaſions ſhould be added in their due places; particularly for thoſe at Sea, together with an Office for the Baptiſm of ſuch as are of riper years; which, although not ſo neceſſary when the former Book was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled, yet by the growth of <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> through the licentiouſneſs of the late Times crept in amongſt us, is now become neceſſary, and may be always uſeful for the baptizing of Natives in our Plantations, and others converted to the Faith. If any man who ſhall deſire a more particular Account of the ſeveral Alterations in any part of the Liturgy, ſhall take the pains to compare the preſent Book with the former; we doubt not but the reaſon of the change may eaſily appear.</p>
            <p>And having thus endeavoured to diſcharge our Duties in this weighty Affair, as in the ſight of God, and to approve our ſincerity therein (ſo far as lay in us) to the Conſciences of all men; although we know it impoſſible (in ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of apprehenſions, humours, and intereſts as are in the world) to pleaſe all; nor can expect that men of facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, peeviſh, and perverſe ſpirits ſhould be ſatisfied with any thing that can be done in this kind by any other then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Yet we have good hope, that what is here preſented, and hath been by the Convocations of both Provinces with great diligence examined and approved, will be alſo well accepted and approved by all ſober, peaceable, and truly conſcientious Sons of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>THere was never any thing by the wit of man ſo well deviſed, or ſo ſure eſtabliſhed, which in continuance of time hath not been corrupted: As among other things, it may plainly appear by the Common Prayers in the Church, commonly called <hi>Divine Service.</hi> The firſt original and ground whereof, if a man would ſearch out by the ancient Fathers, he ſhall find, that the ſame was not ordained but of a good purpoſe, and for a great advancement of godlineſs. For they ſo ordered the matter, that all the whole Bible, (or the greateſt part thereof) ſhould be read over once every year; intending thereby, that the Clergy, and eſpecially ſuch as were Miniſters in the Congregation, ſhould (by often reading, and meditation in Gods Word) be ſtirred up to godlineſs themſelves, and be more able to exhort others by wholſom Doctrine, and to confute them that were Adverſaries to the Truth; and further, that the people (by daily hearing of holy Scripture read in the Church) might continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit more and more in the knowledge of God, and be the more inflamed with the love of his true Religion.</p>
               <p>But theſe many years paſſed, this godly and decent Order of the ancient Fathers hath been ſo altered, broken, and neglected by planting in uncertain Stories and Legends, with multitude of Reſponds, Verſes, vain Repetitions, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorations and Synodals; that commonly, when any Book of the Bible was begun, after three or four Chapters were read out, all the reſt were unread. And in this ſort the Book of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was begun in <hi>Advent,</hi> and the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> in <hi>Septuageſima;</hi> but they were only begun and never read through: After like ſort were other Books of holy Scripture uſed. And moreover, whereas Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would have ſuch Language ſpoken to the people in the Church, as they might underſtand, and have profit by hearing the ſame; the Service in this Church of <hi>England</hi> theſe many years, hath been read in Latin to the people, which they underſtand not; ſo that they have heard with their ears only, and their heart, ſpirit, and mind have not been edified thereby. And furthermore, notwithſtanding that the ancient Fathers have divided the Pſalms into ſeven portions, whereof every one was called a <hi>Nocturn:</hi> Now of late time a few of them have been daily ſaid, and the reſt utterly omitted. Moreover, the number and hardneſs of the Rules called the <hi>Pie,</hi> and the manifold changings of the Service was the cauſe, that to turn the Book only was ſo hard and intricate a matter, that many times there was more buſineſs to find out what ſhould be read, then to read it when it was found out.</p>
               <p>Theſe inconveniences therefore conſidered, here is ſet forth ſuch an Order, whereby the ſame ſhall be redreſſed. And for a readineſs in this matter, here is drawn out a Kalendar for that purpoſe, which is plain and eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; wherein (ſo much as may be) the reading of holy Scripture is ſo ſet forth, that all things ſhall be done in order, without breaking one piece from another. For this cauſe be cut off Anthems, Reſponds, Invitatories, and ſuch like things as did break the continual courſe of the reading of the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Yet, becauſe there is no remedy, but that of neceſſity there muſt be ſome Rules; therefore certain Rules are here ſet forth; which, as they are few in number, ſo they are plain and eaſie to be underſtood. So that here you have an Order for Prayer, and for the reading of the holy Scripture, much agreeable to the mind and purpoſe of the old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and a great deal more profitable and commodious then that which of late was uſed. It is more profitable, becauſe here are left out many things, whereof ſome are untrue, ſome uncertain, ſome vain and ſuperſtitious; and nothing is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be read, but the very pure Word of God, the holy Scriptures, or that which is agreeable to the ſame; and that in ſuch a Language and Order, as is moſt eaſie and plain for the underſtanding both of the Readers and Hearers. It is alſo more commodious, both for the ſhortneſs thereof, and for the plainneſs of the Order, and for that the Rules be few and eaſie.</p>
               <p>And whereas heretofore there hath been great diverſity in ſaying and ſinging in Churches within this Realm; ſome following <hi>Salisbury</hi> Uſe, ſome <hi>Hereford</hi> Uſe, and ſome the Uſe of <hi>Bangor,</hi> ſome of <hi>York,</hi> ſome of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> now from henceforth all the whole Realm ſhall have but one Uſe.</p>
               <p>And foraſmuch as nothing can be ſo plainly ſet forth, but doubts may ariſe in the uſe and practice of the ſame; to appeaſe all ſuch diverſity (if any ariſe) and for the reſolution of all doubts, concerning the manner how to underſtand, do, and execute the things contained in this Book; the parties that ſo doubt, or diverſly take any thing, ſhall alway re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to the Biſhop of the Dioceſs, who by his diſcretion ſhall take order for the quieting and appeaſing of the ſame; ſo that the ſame order be not contrary to any thing contained in this book. And if the Biſhop of the Dioceſs be in doubt, then he may ſend for the Reſolution thereof to the Archbiſhop.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THough it be appointed, That all things ſhall be read and ſung in the Church in the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Tongue, to the end, that the Congregation may be thereby edified; yet it is not meant, but that when men ſay Morning and Evening Prayer privately, they may ſay the ſame in any Language that they themſelves do underſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And all Prieſts and Deacons are to ſay daily the Morning and Evening Prayer, either privately or openly, not being let by ſickneſs, or ſome other urgent cauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Curate that miniſtreth in every Pariſh-Church or Chappel, being at home, and not being otherwiſe reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably hindred, ſhall ſay the ſame in the Pariſh-Church or Chappel where he miniſtreth, and ſhall cauſe a Bell to be tolled thereunto a convenient time before he begin, that the people may come to hear Gods Word, and to pray with him.</hi>

               <head>¶ Of CEREMONIES, Why ſome be aboliſhed, and ſome retained.</head>
               <p>OF ſuch Ceremonies as be uſed in the Church, and have had their beginning by the Inſtitution of Man, ſome at the firſt were of godly intent and purpoſe deviſed, and yet at length turned to vanity and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Some entred into the Church by undiſcreet Devotion, and ſuch a Zeal as was without knowledge; and for becauſe they were winked at in the beginning, they grew daily to more and more abuſes, which not only for their unprofitableneſs, but alſo becauſe they have much blinded the people, and obſcured the Glory of God, are worthy to be cut away, and clean rejected: Other there be, which although they have been deviſed by Man, yet it is thought good to reſerve them ſtill, as well for a decent Order in the Church (for the which they were firſt deviſed) as becauſe they pertain to edification, whereunto all things done in the Church (as the Apoſtle teacheth) ought to be referred.</p>
               <p>And although the keeping or omitting of a Ceremony, in it ſelf conſidered, is but a ſmall thing; yet the wilful and contemptuous trangreſſion and breaking of a common Order and Diſcipline, is no ſmall Offence before God. <hi>Let all things be done among you,</hi> ſaith St. Paul, <hi>in a ſeemly and due order;</hi> The appointment of the which Order, pertaineth not to private men; therefore no man ought to take in hand, or preſume to appoint or alter any publick or common Order in Chriſts Church, except he be lawfully called and authorized thereunto.</p>
               <p>And whereas in this our time, the minds of men are ſo diverſe, that ſome think it a great matter of conſcience to depart from a piece of the leaſt of their Ceremonies, they be ſo addicted to their old cuſtoms; and again on the other ſide, ſome be ſo new-fangled, that they would innovate all things, and ſo deſpiſe the old, that nothing can like them, but that is new: It was thought expedient, not ſo much to have reſpect how to pleaſe and ſatisfie either of theſe parties, as how to pleaſe God, and profit them both. And yet leſt any man ſhould be offended, whom good reaſon might ſatisfie, here be certain cauſes rendred, why ſome of the accuſtomed Ceremonies be put away, and ſome retained and kept ſtill.</p>
               <p>Some are put away, becauſe the great exceſs and multitude of them hath ſo increaſed in theſe latter days, that the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of them was intolerable; whereof St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his time complained, that they were grown to ſuch a number, that the Eſtate of Chriſtian people was in worſe caſe concerning that matter then were the Jews. And he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled, that ſuch yoke and burden ſhould be taken away, as time would ſerve quietly to do it. But what would St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> have ſaid, if he had ſeen the Ceremonies of late days uſed among us; whereunto the multitude uſed in his time was not to be compared? This our exceſſive multitude of Ceremonies was ſo great, and many of them ſo dark, that they did more confound and darken, then declare and ſet forth Chriſts benefits unto us. And beſides this, Chriſts Goſpel is not a Ceremonial Law (as much of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was) but it is a Religion to ſerve God, not in bondage of the figure or ſhadow, but in the freedom of the ſpirit; being content only with thoſe Ceremonies which do ſerve to a decent Order, and godly Diſcipline, and ſuch as be apt to ſtir up the dull mind of man to the remembrance of his duty to God, by ſome notable and ſpecial ſignification, whereby he might be edified. Furthermore, the moſt weighty cauſe of the aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of certain Ceremonies was, That they were ſo far abuſed; partly by the ſuperſtitious blindneſs of the rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, and partly by the unſatiable Avarice of ſuch as ſought more their own lucre, then the Glory of God, that the Abuſes could not well be taken away, the thing remaining ſtill.</p>
               <p>But now as concerning thoſe perſons, which peradventure will be offended, for that ſome of the old Ceremonies are retained ſtill: if they conſider, that without ſome Ceremonies it is not poſſible to keep any Order, or quiet Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in the Church, they ſhall eaſily perceive juſt cauſe to reform their judgments. And if they think much that any of the old do remain, and would rather have all deviſed anew: Then ſuch men granting ſome Ceremonies convenient to be had, ſurely where the old may be well uſed, there they cannot reaſonably reprove the old only for their age, without bewraying of their own folly. For in ſuch a caſe they ought rather to have reverence unto them for their antiquity, if they will declare themſelves to be more ſtudious of unity and concord, then of innovations and new-fangleneſs, which (as much as may be with true ſetting forth of Chriſts Religion) is always to be eſchewed. Furthermore, ſuch ſhall have no juſt cauſe with the Ceremonies reſerved to be offended. For as thoſe are taken away which were moſt abuſed, and did bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den mens conſciences without any cauſe; ſo the other that remain, are retained for a Diſcipline and Order, which (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on juſt cauſes) may be altered and changed, and therefore are not to be eſteemed equal with Gods Law. And moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they be neither dark nor dumb Ceremonies, but are ſo ſet forth, that every man may underſtand what they do mean, and to what uſe they do ſerve. So that it is not like that they in time to come ſhould be abuſed as other have been. And in theſe our doings we condemn no other Nations, nor preſcribe any thing but to our own people only: for we think it convenient, that every Country ſhould uſe ſuch Ceremonies as they ſhall think beſt to the ſetting forth of Gods honour and glory, and to the reducing of the people to a moſt perfect and godly living, without errour or ſuperſtition; and that they ſhould put away other things, Which from time to time, they perceive to be moſt abuſed, as in mens ordinances it often chanceth diverſly in divers Countreys.</p>

               <head>¶ The Order how the Pſalter is appointed to be read.</head>
               <p>THe pſalter ſhall be read through once every month, as it is there appointed, both for Morning and Evening Prayer. But in <hi>February</hi> it ſhall be read only to the Twenty eighth, or Twenty ninth day of the month.</p>
               <p>And whereas <hi>January, March, May, July, Auguſt, October,</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> have One and thirty days apiece; It is ordered, that the ſame Pſalms ſhall be read the laſt day of the ſaid months, which were read the day before: So that the Pſalter may begin again the firſt day of the next month enſuing.</p>
               <p>And whereas the CXIX Pſalm is divided into XXII Portions, and is over long to be read at one time; It is ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that at one time ſhall not be read above four or five of the ſaid Portions.</p>
               <p>And at the end of every Pſalm, and of every ſuch part of the CXIX Pſalm, ſhall be repeated this Hymn,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son: and to the holy Ghoſt; As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever ſhall be: world without end. Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, That the Pſalter followeth the Diviſion of the Hebrews, and the Tranſlation of the Great Engliſh Bible, ſet forth and uſed in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth.</p>

               <p>The New Teſtament is appointed for the ſecond Leſſons at Morning and Evening Prayer, and ſhall be read over orderly every year thrice, beſides the Epiſtles and Goſpels; except the Apocalyps, out of which there are only certain proper Leſſons appointed upon divers Feaſts.</p>
               <p>And to know what Leſſons ſhall be read every day, look for the day of the month in the Kalendar following, and there ye ſhall find the Chapters that ſhall be read for the Leſſons both at Morning and Evening Prayer; Except only the Moveable Feaſts, which are not in the Kalendar, and the immoveable, where there is a blank left in the Column of Leſſons; the proper Leſſons for all which days are to be found in the Table of proper Leſſons.</p>
               <p>And note, that whenſoever proper Pſalms or Leſſons are appointed; then the Pſalms and Leſſons of ordinary courſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the Pſalter and Kalendar (if they be different) ſhall be omitted for that time.</p>

               <p>To the Lord our God belong mercies, and forgiveneſſes, though we have rebelled againſt him: neither have we obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws which he ſet before us. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.9, 10.</p>

               <p>DEarly beloved brethren, the Scripture moveth us in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places to acknowledge and confeſs our manifold ſins and wickedneſs, and that we ſhould not diſſemble nor cloke
<pb facs="tcp:48041:11"/> them before the face of Almighty God our heavenly Father, but confeſs them with an humble, lowly, penitent, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent heart, to the end that we may obtain forgiveneſs of the ſame by his infinite goodneſs and mercy. And although we ought at all times humbly to acknowledge our ſins before God, yet ought we moſt chiefly ſo to do, when we aſſemble and meet together to render thanks for the great benefits that we have received at his hands, to ſet forth his moſt worthy praiſe, to hear his moſt holy word, and to ask thoſe things which are requiſite and neceſſary, as well for the body as the ſoul. Wherefore I pray and beſeech you, as many as are here preſent, to accompany me with a pure heart and humble voice, unto the throne of the heavenly grace, ſaying after me.</p>

               </p>
               <p>ALmighty and moſt merciful Father; We have erred and ſtrayed from thy ways like loſt ſheep. We have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too much the devices and deſires of our own hearts. We have offended againſt thy holy laws. We have left undone thoſe things which we ought to have done; And we have done thoſe things which we ought not to have done; And there is no health in us. But thou, O Lord, have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, miſerable offenders. Spare thou them, O God, which confeſs their faults. Reſtore thou them that are penitent; According to thy promiſes declared unto mankind in Chriſt Jeſu our Lord. And grant, O moſt merciful Father, for his ſake; That we may hereafter live a godly, righteous, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber life, To the glory of thy holy Name. Amen.</p>

               <p>To the Lord our God belong mercies, and forgiveneſſes, though we have rebelled againſt him: neither have we obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws which he ſet before us. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.9, 10.</p>

               <p>And the Catholick Faith is this: That ve worſhip one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity;</p>
               <p>Neither confounding the perſons: nor dividing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>For there is one perſon of the Father, another of the Son: and another of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the
<pb facs="tcp:48041:19"/> Holy Ghoſt is all one: the Glory equal, the Majeſty co-eternal.</p>
               <p>Such as the Father is, ſuch is the Son: and ſuch is the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate: and the Holy Ghoſt uncreate.</p>
               <p>The Father incomprehenſible, the Son incomprehenſible: and the Holy Ghoſt incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p>The Father eternal, the Son eternal: and the Holy Ghoſt eternal.</p>
               <p>And yet they are not three eternals: but one eternal.</p>
               <p>As alſo there are not three incomprehenſibles, nor three uncreated: but one uncreated, and one incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty: and the Holy Ghoſt Almighty.</p>
               <p>And yet they are not three Almighties: but one Almighty.</p>
               <p>So the Father is God, the Son is God: and the Holy Ghoſt is God.</p>
               <p>And yet they are not three Gods: but one God.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe the Father is Lord, the Son Lord: and the Holy Ghoſt Lord;</p>
               <p>And yet not three Lords: but one Lord.</p>
               <p>For like as we are compelled by the Chriſtian verity: to acknowledge every perſon by himſelf to be God and Lord;</p>
               <p>So are we forbidden by the Catholick Religion: to ſay, There be three Gods, or three Lords.</p>
               <p>The Father is made of none: neither created, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
               <p>The Son is of the Father alone: not made, nor created, but begotten.</p>
               <p>The Holy Ghoſt is of the Father, and of the Son: neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.</p>
               <p>So there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons: one Holy Ghoſt, not three Holy Ghoſts.</p>
               <p>And in this Trinity none is afore, or after other: none is greater, or leſs then another;</p>
               <p>But the whole three perſons are co-eternal together: and co-equal.</p>
               <p>So that in all things, as is aforeſaid: the Unity in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Trinity in Unity is to be worſhipped.</p>
               <p>He therefore that will be ſaved: muſt thus think of the Trinity.</p>
               <p>Furthermore it is neceſſary to everlaſting ſalvation: that he alſo believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48041:19"/>
               <p> For the right faith is, that we believe and confeſs: that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, is God and Man;</p>
               <p>God of the ſubſtance of the Father, begotten before the Worlds: and Man of the ſubſtance of his Mother, born in the World;</p>
               <p>Perfect God, and perfect Man: of a reaſonable ſoul, and humane fleſh ſubſiſting;</p>
               <p>Equal to the Father, as touching his Godhead: and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Father, as touching his Manhood.</p>
               <p>Who although he be God, and Man: yet he is not two, but one Chriſt;</p>
               <p>One; not by converſion of the Godhead into fleſh: but by taking of the Manhood into God;</p>
               <p>One altogether; not by confuſion of ſubſtance: but by unity of perſon.</p>
               <p>For as the reaſonable ſoul and fleſh is one man: ſo God and Man is one Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Who ſuffered for our ſalvation: deſcended into hell, roſe again the third day from the dead.</p>
               <p>He aſcended into heaven, he ſitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty: from whence he ſhall come to judge the quick and the dead.</p>

Love worketh no ill to his neighbour, therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.

Unto me, who am leſs then the leaſt of all ſaints, is this grace given, that I ſhould preach among the Gentiles the unſearchable riches of Chriſt; and to make all men ſee, what is the fellowſhip of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt: To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places, might be known by the Church the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold wiſdom of God, according to the eternal purpoſe which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.

When Herod the king had heard theſe things, he was troubled, and all Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief prieſts and ſcribes of the people together, he demanded of them, where Chriſt ſhould be born. And they ſaid unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea: For thus it is written by the prophet, And thou Bethlehem in the land of Juda, art not the leaſt among the princes of Juda: For out of thee ſhall come a Governour that ſhall rule my people Iſrael. Then Herod, when he had privily called the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, enquired of them diligently what time the ſtar ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. And he ſent them to Bethlehem, and ſaid, Go, and ſearch diligently for the young child, and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worſhip him alſo. When they had heard the king, they departed; and lo, the ſtar which they ſaw in the eaſt, went before them, till it came and ſtood over where the young child was. When they ſaw the ſtar, they rejoyced with exceeding great joy. And when they were come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe, they ſaw the young child with Mary his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and fell down and worſhipped him: And when they had opened their treaſures, they preſented unto him gifts, gold, and frankincenſe, and myrrhe.

                  <p>THe kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an houſholder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard. And when he had agreed with the labourers for a peny a day, he ſent them into his vineyard. And he went out about the third hour, and ſaw others ſtanding idle in the market-place, and ſaid unto them, Go ye alſo into the vineyard, and whatſoever is right, I will give you. And they went their way. Again he went out about the ſixth and ninth hour, and did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others ſtanding idle, and ſaith unto them, Why ſtand ye here all the day idle? They ſay unto him, Becauſe no man hath hired us. He ſaith unto them, Go ye alſo into the vineyard, and whatſoever is right, that ſhall ye receive. So when even was come, the Lord of the vineyard ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſteward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire,
<pb facs="tcp:48041:36"/> beginning from the laſt unto the firſt. And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived every man a peny. But when the firſt came, they ſuppoſed that they ſhould have received more; and they likewiſe received every man a peny. And when they had received it, they murmured againſt the good-man of the houſe, ſaying, Theſe laſt have wrought but one hour, and thou haſt made them equal unto us, which have born the burden and heat of the day. But he anſwered one of them, and ſaid, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didſt not thou agree with me for a peny? Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this laſt even as unto thee. Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, becauſe I am good? So the laſt ſhall be firſt, and the firſt laſt: for many be called, but few choſen.</p>

And ſome fell upon a rock, and as ſoon as it was ſprung up, it withered away, becauſe it lacked moiſture. And ſome fell among thorns, and the thorns ſprang up with it, and choked it.

                  <p>JEſus was caſting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to paſs when the devil was gone out, the dumb ſpake; and the people wondred. But ſome of them ſaid, He caſteth out devils through Beelzebub, the chief of the devils. And other tempting him, ſought of him a ſign from heaven. But he knowing their thoughts, ſaid unto them, Every kingdom divided againſt it ſelf, is brought to deſolation; and a houſe divided againſt a houſe, falleth. If Satan alſo be divided againſt himſelf, how ſhall his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſtand? becauſe ye ſay that I caſt out devils through Beelzebub. And if I by Beelzebub caſt out devils, by whom do your ſons caſt them out? therefore ſhall they be your judges.

He that is not with me, is againſt me: and he that gathereth not with me, ſcattereth. When the unclean ſpirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, ſeeking reſt; and finding none, he ſaith, I will return unto my houſe whence I came out. And when he cometh, he findeth it ſwept and garniſhed. Then goeth he and taketh to him ſeven other ſpirits more wicked then himſelf, and they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, and dwell there; and the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe then the firſt. And it came to paſs as he ſpake theſe things, a certain woman of the company lift up her voice, and ſaid unto him, Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps which thou haſt ſucked. But he ſaid, Yea, rather bleſſed are they that hear the Word of God, and keep it.</p>

                  <p>TEll me that deſire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? For it is written, that Abraham had two ſons, the one by a bond-maid, the other by a free-woman. But he who was of the bond-woman, was born after the fleſh; but he of the free-woman was by promiſe. Which things are an allegory: for theſe are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendreth to bondage, which is Agar. For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and anſwereth to Jeruſalem which now is, and is in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage with her children. But Jeruſalem which is above is free; which is the mother of us all. For it is written, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce thou barren that beareſt not; break forth and cry; thou that traivaileſt not: for the deſolate hath many mo children then ſhe which hath an husband. Now we bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as Iſaac was, are the children of promiſe. But as then, he that was born after the fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the ſpirit; even ſo it is now. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, what ſaith the Scripture? Caſt out the bond-woman and her ſon; for the ſon of the bond-woman ſhall not be heir with the ſon of the free-woman. So then, brethren, we are not children of the bond-woman, but of the free.</p>

And Jeſus went up into a mountain, and there he ſat with his diſciples. And the paſſover, a feaſt of the Jews, was nigh. When Jeſus then lift up his eyes, and ſaw a great company come unto him, he ſaith unto Philip, Whence ſhall we buy bread, that theſe may eat? (And this he ſaid to prove him; for he himſelf knew what he would do.) Philip anſwered him, Two hundred peny-worth of bread is not ſufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little. One of his diſciples, Andrew, Simon Peters brother, ſaith unto him, There is a lad here, which hath five barley-loaves, and two ſmall fiſhes: but what are they among ſo many? And Jeſus ſaid, Make the men ſit down. Now there was much graſs in the place. So the men ſat down, in number about five thousand. And Jeſus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he deſtributed to the diſciples, and the diſciples to them that were ſet

                  <p>WHen the morning was come, all the chief prieſts and elders of the people took counſel againſt Jeſus to put him to death. And when they had bound him, they
<pb facs="tcp:48041:41"/> led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. Then Judas who had betrayed him, when he ſaw that he was condemned, repented himſelf, and brought again the thirty pieces of ſilver to the chief prieſts and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſaying, I have ſinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent bloud. And they ſaid, What is that to us? ſee thou to that. And he caſt down the pieces of ſilver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himſelf. And the chief prieſts took the ſilver pieces, and ſaid, It is not lawful for to put them into the treaſury, becauſe it is the price of bloud. And they took counſel, and bought with them the potters field to bury ſtrangers in. Wherefore that field was called, The field of bloud unto this day. (Then was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by Jeremy the prophet, ſaying, And they took the thirty pieces of ſilver, the price of him that was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, whom they of the children of Iſrael did value, and gave them for the potters field, as the Lord appointed me.) And Jeſus ſtood before the governour; and the governour asked him, ſaying, Art thou the King of the Jews? and Jeſus ſaid unto him, Thou ſeyeſt. And when he was accuſed of the chief prieſts and elders, he anſwered nothing. Then ſaith Pilate unto him, Heareſt thou not how many things they witneſs againſt thee? And he anſwered him to never a word, inſomuch that the governour marvelled greatly. Now at that feaſt the governour was wont to releaſe unto the people a priſoner, whom they would. And they had then a notable priſoner, called Barabbas. Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate ſaid unto them, whom will ye that I releaſe unto you? Barabbas, or Jeſus, which is called Chriſt? For he knew that for envy they had delivered him. When he was ſet down on the judgment-ſeat, his wife ſent unto him, ſaying, Have thou nothing to do with that juſt man: for I have ſuffered many things this day in a dream be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of him. But the chief prieſts and elders perſwaded the multitude that they ſhould ask Barabbas, and deſtroy Jeſus. The governour anſwered and ſaid unto them, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the twain will ye that I releaſe unto you? They ſaid, Barabbas. Pilate ſaith unto them, What ſhall I do then with Jeſus, which is called Chriſt? They all ſay unto him, Let him be crucified. And the governour ſaid, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, ſaying, Let him be crucified. When Pilate ſaw that he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and waſhed his hands before the multitude, ſaying,
<pb facs="tcp:48041:42"/> I am innocent of the bloud of this juſt perſon: ſee ye to it. Then anſwered all the people, and ſid, His bloud be on us, and on our children. Then releaſed he Barabbas unto them: and when he had ſcourged Jeſus, he delivered him to be crucified. Then the ſouldiers of the governour took Jeſus into the common hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of ſouldiers. And they ſtripped him, and put on him a ſcarlet robe. And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, ſaying, Hail, king of the Jews. And they ſpit upon him, and took the reed, and ſmote him on the head. And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucifie him. And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his croſs. And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to ſay, a place of a ſcull, they gave him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall: and when he had taſted thereof, he would not drink. And they cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him, and parted his garments, caſting lots: that it might be fulfilled, which was ſpoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my veſture did they caſt lots. And ſitting down, they watched him there; and ſet up over his head his accuſation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. Then were there two thieves crucified with him: one on the right hand, and another on the left. And they that paſſed by reviled him, wagging their heads, and ſaying, Thou that deſtroyeſt the temple, and buildeſt it in three days, ſave thy ſelf: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the croſs. Likewiſe alſo the chief prieſts mocking him, with the ſcribes and elders, ſaid, He ſaved others, himſetf he cannot ſave: if he be the King of Iſrael, let him now come down from the croſs, and we will believe him. He truſted in God; let him deliver him now if he will have him: for he ſaid, I am the Son of God. The thieves alſo which were cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with him, caſt the ſame in his teeth. Now from the ſixth hour there was darkneſs over all the land, unto the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour, Jeſes cried with a loud voice, ſaying, <hi>Eli, Eli, lama ſabachtbani?</hi> that is to ſay, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Some of them that ſtood there, when they heard that, ſaid, This man cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for Elias. And ſtraightway one of them ran, and took a

The reſt ſaid, Let be, let us ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elias will come to ſave him. Jeſus, when he had cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghoſt. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened, and many bodies of ſaints which ſlept, aroſe and came out of the graves after his refurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many. Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching Jeſus, ſaw the earthquake, and thoſe things that were done, they feared greatly, ſaying, Truly this was the Son of God.</p>

But they ſaid, Not on the feaſt-day, leſt there be an uprore of the people. And being in Bethany, in the houſe of Simon the leper, as he ſat at meat, there came a woman, having an alabaſter-box of ointment of ſpikenard, very precious, and ſhe brake the box, and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it on his head.

For it might have been ſold for more then three hundred pence, and have been given to the poor: and they murmured againſt her. And Jeſus ſaid, Let her alone, why trouble you her? ſhe hath wrought a good work on me. For ye have the poor with you always, and whenſoever ye will, ye may do them good: but me ye have not always.

And he will ſhew you a large upper room fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and prepared, there make ready for us. And his diſciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had ſaid unto them: and they made ready the paſſover. And in the evening he cometh with the twelve. And as they ſat, and did eat, Jeſus ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, one of you which eateth with me, ſhall betray me. And they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſorrowful, and to ſay unto him one by one, Is it I? and another ſaid, Is it I? And he anſwered and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, It is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the diſh. The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but wo to that man by whom the Son of man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed: good were it for that man if he had never been born. And as they did eat, Jeſus took bread, and bleſſed, and brake it, and gave to them, and ſaid, Take, eat: This is my body. And he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them: and they all drank of it. And he ſaid unto them, This is my bloud of the new teſtament, which is ſhed for many. Verily I ſay unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God. And when they had ſung un hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. And Jeſus ſaith unto them, All ye ſhall be offended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of me this night: for it is written, I will ſmite the ſhepherd, and the ſheep ſhall be ſcattered. But after that I am riſen, I will go before you into Galilee. But Peter ſaid unto him, Although all ſhall be offended, yet will not I. And Jeſus ſaith unto him, Verily I ſay unto thee, that this day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou ſhalt deny me thrice. But he ſpake the more vehemently,
<pb facs="tcp:48041:44"/> If I ſhould die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wiſe. Likewiſe alſo ſaid they all. And they came to a place which was named Gethſemane: and he ſaith to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Sit ye here, while I ſhall pray. And he taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and began to be ſore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, and to be very heavy, and ſaith unto them, My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful unto death; tarry ye here, and watch. And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed, that if it were poſſible the hour might paſs from him. And he ſaid, Abba, Father; all things are poſſible unto thee; take away this cup from me: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, not what I will, but what thou wilt. And he cometh and findeth them ſleeping, and ſaith unto Peter, Simon, ſleepeſt thou? couldſt not thou watch one hour? Watch ye and pray, leſt ye enter into temptation: the ſpirit truly is ready, but the fleſh is weak. And again he went away, and prayed and ſpake the ſame words. And when he returned, he found them aſleep again, (for their eyes were heavy) neither wiſt they what to anſwer him.

I was daily with you in the temple, teaching, and ye took me not: but the Scriptures muſt be fulfilled. And they all forſook him, and fled. And there followed him a certain young man, having a linen cloth caſt about his naked boby; and the young men laid hold on him. And he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.

And there aroſe certain, and bare falſe witneſs againſt him, ſaying, We heard him ſay, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo did their witneſs agree together. And the high Prieſt ſtood up in the midſt, and asked Jeſus, ſaying, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereſt thou nothing? what is it which theſe witneſs againſt thee? But he held his peace, and anſwered nothing. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the high Prieſt asked him, and ſaid unto him, Art thou the Chriſt, the Son of the Bleſſed? And Jeſus ſaid, I am; and ye ſhall ſee the Son of man ſitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. Then the high Prieſt rent his clothes, and ſaith, What need we any further witneſſes? ye have heard the blaſphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death. And ſome began to ſpit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to ſay unto him, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; and the ſervants did ſtrike him with the palms of their hands. And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth one of the maids of the high prieſt; and when ſhe ſaw Peter warming himſelf, ſhe looked upon him, and ſaid, And thou alſo waſt with Jeſus of Nazareth. But he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaying, I know not, neither underſtand I what thou ſayeſt. And he went out into the porch, and the cock crew. And a maid ſaw him again, and began to ſay to them that ſtood by. This is one of them. And he denied it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And a little after, they that ſtood by ſaid again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them; for thou art a Galile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and thy ſpeech agreeth thereto. But he began to curſe and to ſwear, ſaying, I know not this man of whom ye ſpeak. And the ſecond time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the word that Jeſus ſaid unto him, Before the crow twice, thou ſhalt deny me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.</p>

                  <p>ANd ſtraightway in the morning, the chief prieſts held a conſultation with the elders and ſcribes, and the whole council, and bound Jeſus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. And Pilate asked him, Art thou the king of the Jews? And he anſwering, ſaid unto him, Thou ſayeſt it. And the chief prieſts accuſed him of many things: but he anſwered nothing. And Pilate asked him again, ſaying, Anſwereſt thou nothing? behold how many things they witneſſ againſt thee. But Jeſus yet anſwered nothing: ſo that Pilate marvelled. Now at that feaſt he releaſed unto them one priſoner, whomſoever they deſired. And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made inſurrection with him, who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted murder in the inſurrection. And the multitude crying aloud, began to deſire him to do as he had ever done unto them. But Pilate anſwered them, ſaying, Will ye that I releaſe unto you the king of the Jews? (For he knew that the chief prieſts had delivered him for envy) But the chief prieſts moved the people, that he ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther releaſe Barabbas unto them. And Pilate anſwered, and ſaid again unto them, What will ye then that I ſhall do unto him whom ye call the king of the Jews? And they cried out again, Crucifie him. Then Pilate ſaid unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, Crucifie him. And ſo Pilate, willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the people, releaſed Barabbas unto them, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jeſus, when he had ſcourged him, to be crucified. And
<pb facs="tcp:48041:45"/> the ſouldiers led him away into the hall called Pretorium and they call together the whole band. And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head, and began to ſalute him, Hail king of the Jews. And they ſmote him on the head with a reed, and did ſpit upon him, and bowing their knees, worſhipped him. And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucifie him. And they compel one Simon a Cyrenean, who passed by, coming out of the countrey, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his croſs. And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, the place of a ſcull. And they gave him to drink, wine mingled with myrrhe; but he received it not. And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, caſting lots upon them, what every man ſhould take. And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. And the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of his accuſation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. And with him they crucifie two thieves, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith, And he was numbred with the tranſgreſſours. And they that paſſed by, railed on him, wagging their heads, and ſaying, Ah, thou that deſtroyeſt the temple, and buildeſt it in three days, ſave thy ſelf, and come down from the croſs. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo the chief prieſts mocking, ſaid among themſelves, with the ſcribes, He ſaved others, himſelf he cannot ſave. Let Chriſt the king of Iſrael deſcend now from the croſs, that we may ſee and believe. And they that were crucified with him, reviled him. And when the ſixth hour was come, there was darkneſs over the whole land, until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour, Jeſus cried with a loud voice, ſaying, <hi>Eloi, Eloi, lama ſabachtbani?</hi> which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? And ſome of them that ſtood by, when they heard it, ſaid, Behold, he calleth Elias. And one ran, and filled ſpunge full of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, ſaying, Let alone; let us ſee whether Elias will come to take him down. And Jeſus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghoſt. And the vail of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. And when the centurion which ſtood over againſt him, ſaw that he ſo cried out, and gave up the ghoſt, he ſaid, Truly this man was the Son of God.</p>

Whereupon, neither the firſt teſtament was dedicated without bloud: for when Moſes had ſpoken every precept to all the people, according to the law, he took the bloud of calves, and of goats, with water and ſcarlet wooll, and hyſſop, and ſprinkled both the book and all the people, ſaying, This is the bloud of the teſtament, which God hath enjoyned unto you. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he ſprinkled likewiſe with bloud both the tabernacle, and all the veſſels of the miniſtry. And almoſt all things are by the law purged with bloud; and without ſhedding of bloud is no remiſſion. It was therefore neceſſary that the patterns of things in the heavens ſhould be purified with theſe; but the heavenly things themſelves with better ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices then theſe. For Chriſt is not entred into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly places made with hands, which are the figures of the true, but into heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us; nor yet that he ſhould offer himſelf often, as the high prieſt entreth into the holy place every year with bloud of others: for then muſt he often have ſuffered ſince the foundation of the world; but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf. And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the Judgment: ſo Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many; and unto them that look for him, ſhall he appear the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation.</p>

Then entred Satan into Judas ſirnamed Iſcariot, being of the number of the twelve. And he went his way, and communed with the chief Prieſts and captains how he might betray him unto them. And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. And he promiſed, and ſought opportunity to betray him unto them, in the abſence of the multitude. Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the paſſover muſt be killed. And he ſent Peter and John, ſaying, Go and prepare us the paſſover, that we may eat. And they ſaid unto him, Where wilt thou that we
<pb facs="tcp:48041:46"/> prepare? And he ſaid unto them, Behold, when ye are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the city, there ſhall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the houſe where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth in. And ye ſhall ſay unto the good-man of the houſe, The maſter ſaith unto thee, Where is the gueſt-chamber, where I ſhall eat the paſſover with my diſciples? And he ſhall ſhew you a large upper room furniſhed; there make ready. And they went, and found as he had ſaid unto them: and they made ready the paſſover. And when the hour was come, he ſat down, and the twelve Apoſtles with him. And he ſaid unto them, With deſire I have deſired to eat this paſſover with you before I ſuffer. For I ſay unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and ſaid, Take this, and divide it among your ſelves. For I ſay unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God ſhall come. And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This is my body, which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. Likewiſe alſo the cup after ſupper, ſaying, This cup is the new Teſtament in my bloud, which is ſhed for you. But behold, the hand of him that betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, is with me on the table. And truly the Son of man goeth as it was determined; but wo unto that man, by whom he is betrayed. And they began to enquire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, which of them it was that ſhould do this thing. And there was alſo a ſtrife among them, which of them ſhould be accounted the greateſt. And he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, The kings of the Gentiles exerciſe lordſhip over them, and they that exerciſe authority upon them, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led benefactours. But ye ſhall not be ſo; but he that is greateſt among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth ſerve. For whether is greater, he that ſitteth at meat, or he that ſerveth? is not he that ſitteth at meat? But I am among you as he that ſerveth. Ye are they which have continued with me in my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations. And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and ſit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Iſrael. And the Lord ſaid, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not; and when thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And he ſaid unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with

And he ſaid unto them, When I ſent you without purſe, and ſcrip, and ſhoes, lacked ye any thing? And they ſaid, Nothing. Then ſaid he unto them, But now, he that hath a purſe, let him take it, and likewiſe his ſcrip: and he that hath no ſword, let him ſell his garment, and buy one. For I ſay unto you, that this that is written, muſt yet be accompliſhed in me, And he was reckoned among the tranſgreſſours: for the things concerning me have an end. And they ſaid, Lord, behold, here are two ſwords. And he ſaid unto them, It is enough. And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives, and his diſciples alſo followed him. And when he was at the place, he ſaid unto them, Pray, that ye enter not into temptation. And he was withdrawn from them about a ſtones caſt, and kneeled down; and prayed, ſaying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheleſs, not my will, but thine be done. And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening him. And being in an agony, he prayed more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and his ſweat was as it were great drops of bloud fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down to the ground. And when he roſe up from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and was come to his diſciples, he found them ſleeping for ſorrow, and ſaid unto them, Why ſleep ye? riſe and pray, leſt ye enter into temptation. And while he yet ſpake, behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jeſus to kiſs him. But Jeſus ſaid unto him, Judas, betrayeſt thou the Son of man with a kiſs? When they who were about him, ſaw what would follow, they ſaid unto him, Lord, ſhall we ſmite with the ſword? And one of them ſmote the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the high Prieſt, and cut off his right ear. And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, Suffer ye thus far. And he touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ear, and healed him. Then Jeſus ſaid unto the chief Prieſts, and captains of the temple, and the Elders who were come to him, Be ye come out as againſt a thief, with ſwords and ſtaves? When I was daily with you in the temple, ye ſtretched forth no hands againſt me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkneſs. Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high Prieſts houſe, and Peter followed afar off. And when they had kindled a fire in the midſt of the hall, and were ſet down together, Peter ſat down among them. But a certain maid

And about the ſpace of one hour after, another confidently affirmed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Of a truth this fellow alſo was with him; for he is a Galilean. And Peter ſaid, Man, I know not what thou ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. And immediately while he yet ſpake, the cock crew. And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter; and Peter remembred the word of the Lord, how he had ſaid unto him, Before the cock crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice. And Peter went out and wept bitterly. And the men that held Jeſus, mocked him, and ſmote him. And when they had blind-folded him, they ſtruck him on the face, and asked him, ſaying, Propheſie, who is it that ſmote thee? And many other things blaſphemouſly ſpake they againſt him. And as ſoon as it was day, the elders of the people, and the chief prieſts and the ſcribes came together, and led him into their council, ſaying, Art thou the Chriſt? tell us. And he ſaid unto them, If I tell you, you will not believe. And if I alſo ask you, you will not anſwer me, nor let me go. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall the Son of man ſit on the right hand of the power of God. Then ſaid they all, Art thou the Son of God? And he ſaid unto them, Ye ſay that I am.

For I have received of the Lord that which alſo I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jeſus,

After the ſame manner alſo he took the cup, when he had ſupped, ſaying, This cup is the new teſtament in my bloud: this do ye as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come. Wherefore whoſoever ſhall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord. But let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords body. For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep. For if we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one for another. And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation.

And they began to accuſe him, ſaying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Ceſar, ſaying, that he himſelf is Chriſt a king. And Pilate asked him, ſaying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he anſwered him and ſaid, Thou ſayeſt it. Then ſaid Pilate to the chief Prieſts, and to the people, I find no fault in this man. And they were the more fierce, ſaying, He ſtirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from Galilee to this place. When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean. And as ſoon as he knew that he belonged unto Herods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, he ſent him to Herod, who himſelf was alſo at Jeruſalem at that time. And when Herod ſaw Jeſus, he was exceeding glad, for he was deſirous to ſee him of a long ſeaſon, becauſe he had heard many things of him, and he hoped to have ſeen ſome miracle done by him. Then he queſtioned with him in many words; but he anſwered him nothing. And the chieſ Prieſts and Scribes ſtood and vehemently accuſed him. And Herod with his men of war ſet him at nought, and mocked him and arayed him in a

And Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, when he had called together the chief prieſts, and the rulers, and the people, ſaid unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people, and behold, I having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching thoſe things whereof ye accuſe him: No, nor yet Herod: for I ſent you to him, and lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. I will therefore chaſtiſe him, and releaſe him. For of neceſſity he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe one unto them at the feaſt. And they cried out all at once, ſaying, Away with this man, and releaſe unto us Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas: (Who for a certain ſedition made in the city, and for murder was caſt in priſon) Pilate therefore willing to releaſe Jeſus, ſpake again to them. But they cried, ſaying, Crucifie him, crucifie him. And he ſaid unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cauſe of death, in him: I will therefore chaſtiſe him, and let him go. And they were inſtant with loud voices, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring that he might be crucified: and the voices of them, and of the chief prieſts prevailed. And Pilate gave ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, that it ſhould be as they required. And he releaſed unto them, him that for ſedition and murder was caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon, whom they had deſired; but he delivered Jeſus to their will. And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon a Cyrenean, coming out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and on him they laid the croſs, that he might bear it after Jeſus. And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, who alſo bewailed and lamented him. But Jeſus turning unto them, ſaid, Daughters of Jeruſalem, weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves, and for your children. For behold, the days are coming, in which they ſhall ſay, Bleſſed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave ſuck. Then ſhall they begin to ſay to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. For if they do theſe things in a green tree, what ſhall be done in the dry? And there were alſo two other malefactours led with him to be put to death. And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified him; and the malefactours, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. Then ſaid Jeſus, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and caſt lots. And the people ſtood
<pb facs="tcp:48041:49"/> beholding; and the rulers alſo with them derided him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, He ſaved others, let him ſave himſelf, if he be Chriſt the choſen of God. And the ſouldiers alſo mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, and ſaying, If thou be the king of the Jews, ſave thy ſelf. And a ſuperſcription alſo was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. And one of the malefactours, which were hanged, railed on him, ſaying, If thou be Chriſt, ſave thy ſelf and us. But the other anſwering, rebuked him, ſaying, Doſt not thou fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation? And we indeed juſtly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing amiſs. And he ſaid unto Jeſus, Lord, remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom. And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Verily I ſay unto thee, To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe. And it was about the ſixth hour. And there was a darkneſs over all the earth, until the ninth hour. And the ſun was darkened, and the vail of the temple was rent in the midſt. And when Jeſus had cried with a loud voice, he ſaid, Father, into thy hands I commend my ſpirit: and having ſaid thus, he gave up the ghoſt.

                  <p>THe law having a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with thoſe ſacrifices which they offered year by year conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, make the comers thereunto perfect: for then would they not have ceaſed to be offered; becauſe that the worſhippers once purged, ſhould have had no more conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of ſins. But in thoſe ſacrifices there is a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance again made of ſins every year. For it is not poſſible that the bloud of bulls and of goats ſhould take away ſins: Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he ſaith, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and offering thou wouldeſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me: In burnt-offerings, and ſacrifices for ſin thou haſt had no pleaſure: Then ſaid I, Lo, I come (in the Volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God. Above, when he ſaid, Sacrifice and offering, and burnt-offerings, and offering for ſin thou wouldeſt not, neither hadſt pleaſure therein, which are offered by the law: Then ſaid he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the firſt, that he may eſtabliſh the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. By the which will we are ſanctified, through the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all. And every prieſt ſtandeth daily miniſtring, and offering often times the ſame ſacrifices which can never take away ſins. But this man after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſins, for ever ſat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot-ſtool. For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Holy Ghoſt alſo is a witneſs to us: For after that he had ſaid before, This is the covenant that I will make with them that after thoſe days, ſaith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; and their ſins and iniquities will I remember no
<pb facs="tcp:48041:50"/> more. Now where remiſſion of theſe is, there is no more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for ſin. Having therefore, brethren, boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the bloud of Jeſus, by a new and living way, which he hath conſecrated for us, through the vail, that is to ſay, his fleſh: And having an high Prieſt over the houſe of God; let us draw near with a true heart, in full aſſurance of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and our bodies waſhed with pure water. Let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering: (for he is faithful that promiſed) And let us conſider one another to provoke unto love, and to good works; not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſome is; but exhorting one another: and ſo much the more, as ye ſee the day approching.</p>

                  <p>PIlate therefore took Jeſus, and ſcourged him. And the ſouldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe, and ſaid, Hail king of the Jews: And they ſmote him with their hands. Pilate therefore went forth again, and ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. Then came Jeſus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate ſaith unto them, Behold the man. When the chief Prieſts therefore and officers ſaw him, they cried out, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Crucifie him, crucifie him. Pilate ſaith unto them, Take ye him, and crucifie him: for I find no fault in him. The Jews anſwered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God. When Pilate therefore heard that ſaying, he was the more afraid; and went again into the judgment-hall, and ſaith unto Jeſus, Whence art thou? But Jeſus gave him no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Then ſaith Pilate unto him, Speakeſt thou not unto me? knoweſt thou not, that I have power to crucifie thee, and have power to releaſe thee? Jeſus anſwered, Thou could<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have no power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater ſin. And from thenceforth Pilate ſought to releaſe him: but the Jews cried out, ſaying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Ceſars friend: Whoſoever maketh himſelf a king, ſpeaketh againſt Ceſar. When Pilate therefore heard that ſaying, he brought Jeſus forth, and ſat down in the judgment-ſeat, in a place that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. And it
<pb facs="tcp:48041:50"/> was the preparation of the paſſover, and about the ſixth hour: and he ſaith unto the Jews, Behold your king. But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucifie him. Pilate ſaith unto them, Shall I crucifie your king? The chief Prieſts anſwered, We have no king but Ceſar. Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and they took Jeſus and led him away. And he bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his croſs, went forth into a place called the place of a ſcull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha: Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either ſide one, and Jeſus in the midſt. And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the croſs. And the writing was, <hi>JESUS OF NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</hi> This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jeſus wa crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, and Greek, and Latin. Then ſaid the chief Prieſt of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The king of the Jews; but that he ſaid, I am the king of the Jews. Pilate anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, What I have written, I have written. Then the ſouldiers, when they had crucified Jeſus, took his garments (and made four parts, to every ſouldier a part) and alſo his coat: now the coat was without ſeam, woven from the top throughout. They ſaid therefore among themſelves, Let us not rend it, but caſt lots for it, whoſe it ſhall be: that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which ſaith, They parted my raiment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and for my veſture they did caſt lots. Theſe things therefore the ſouldiers did. Now there ſtood by the croſs of Jeſus, his mother, and his mothers ſiſter, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalen. When Jeſus therefore ſaw his mother, and the diſciple ſtanding by, whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he ſaith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy ſon. Then ſaith he to the diſciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour that diſciple took her unto his own home. After this, Jeſus knowing that all things were accompliſhed, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, ſaith, I thirſt. Now there was ſet a veſſel full of vinegar: and they filled a ſpunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyſſop, and put it to his mouth. When Jeſus therefore had received the vinegar, he ſaid, It is finiſhed: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghoſt. The Jews therefore becauſe it was the preparation, that the bodies ſhould not remain upon the croſs on the ſabbath-day (for that ſabbath-day was an high day) beſought Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. Then came the ſouldiers, and brake the legs
<pb facs="tcp:48041:51"/> of the firſt, and of the other which was crucified with him. But when they came to Jeſus, and ſaw that he was dead al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, they brake not his legs. But one of the ſouldiers with a ſpear pierced his ſide, and forthwith came there out bloud and water. And he that ſaw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he ſaith true, that ye might believe. For theſe things were done, that the Scripture ſhould be fulfilled, A bone of him ſhall not be broken. And again, another Scripture ſaith, They ſhall look on him, whom they peirced.</p>

And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a ſepulchre.

And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promiſe which was made unto the fathers; God hath fulfilled the ſame unto us their children, in that he hath raiſed up Jeſus again, as it is alſo written in the ſecond pſalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.

For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt: and theſe three are one. And there are three that bear witneſs in earth, the ſpirit, and the water, and the bloud: and theſe three agree in one.

                  <p>WHen the day of Pentecoſt was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And ſuddenly there came a ſound from heaven, as of a ruſhing mighty wind, and it filled all the houſe where they were ſitting. And there appeared unto them cloven tongues, like as of fire, and it ſat upon each of them: And they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. And there were dwelling at Jeruſalem, Jews, devout men, out of every Nation under heaven. Now when this was noiſed abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, becauſe that every man heard them ſpeak in his own language. And they were all amazed, and marvelled, ſaying one to another, Behold, are not all theſe which ſpeak, Galileans? And how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Meſopotamia, and in Judea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Aſia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Lybia, about Cyrene, and ſtrangers of Rome, Jews and Proſelytes, Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them ſpeak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</p>

And I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knwoeth him; but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you. I will not leave you comfortleſs; I will come to you. Yet a little while, and the world ſeeth me no more; but ye ſee me: becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.

Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. He that loveth me not, keepeth not my ſayings: and the word which you hear, is not mine, but the Fathers which ſent me. Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, being yet preſent with you. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, whatſoever I have ſaid unto you. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. Ye have heard how I ſaid unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, becauſe I ſaid, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater then I. And now I have told you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come to paſs, that when it is come to paſs, ye might believe.

The word which God ſent unto the children of Iſrael, preaching peace by Jeſus Chriſt, (he is Lord of all) That word, I ſay, you know, which was publiſhed throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee, after the baptiſm which John preached: How God anointed
<pb facs="tcp:48041:58"/> Jeſus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghoſt and with power, who went about doing good, and healing all that were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed of the devil: for God was with him. And we are witneſſes of all things which he did, both in the land of the Jews, and in Jeruſalem; whom they ſlew and hanged on a tree: Him God raiſed up the third day, and ſhewed him openly; not to all the people, but unto witneſſes choſen before of God; even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he roſe from the dead. And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to teſtifie that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead. To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his Name who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins. While Peter yet ſpake theſe words, the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them who heard the word. And they of the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion who believed, were aſtoniſed, as many as came with Peter, becauſe that on the Gentiles alſo was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghoſt. For they heard them ſpeak with tongues, and magnifie God. Then anſwered Peter, Can any man forbid water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, who have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days.</p>

And immediately I was in the Spirit; and behold, a throne was ſet in heaven, and one ſat on the throne, and he that ſat, was, to look upon, like a jaſper, and a ſardine ſtone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in ſight like unto an emerald. And round about the throne were four and twenty ſeats; and upon the ſeats I ſaw four and twenty elders ſitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold. And out of the throne proceeded lightnings, and thundrings, and voices. And there were ſeven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the ſeven Spirits of God. And before the throne there was a ſea of glaſs like unto cryſtal: and in the midſt of the throne, and round about the throne, were four beaſts full of eyes before and behind. And the firſt beaſt was like a lion, and the ſecond beaſt like a calf, and the third beaſt had a face as a man, and the fourth beaſt was like a flying eagle. And the four beaſts had each of them ſix wings about him, and they were full of eyes within, and they reſt not day and night, ſaying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and is, and is to come. And when thoſe beaſts give glory, and honour, and thanks to him that ſat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, the four and twenty elders fall down before him that ſat on the throne, and worſhip him that liveth for ever and ever, and caſt their crowns before the throne, ſaying, Thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power; for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are and were created.</p>

That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is ſpirit. Marvel not that I ſaid unto thee, ye muſt be born again.

Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins. Beloved, if God ſo loved us, we ought alſo to love one another. No man hath ſeen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.

And we have ſeen and do teſtifie, that the Father ſent the Son to be the Saviour of the world. Whoſoever ſhall confeſs that Jeſus is the Son of

God is love; and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him. Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldneſs in the day of judgment, becauſe as he is, ſo are we are in this world. There is no fear in love, but perfect love caſteth out fear; becauſe fear hath torment: He that feareth, is not made perfect in love. We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us. If a man ſay, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother, whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?

After that, he was ſeen of James; then of all the Apoſtles; and laſt of all he was ſeen of me alſo, as of one born out of due time: For I am the leaſt of the Apoſtles, that am not meet to be called an Apoſtle, becauſe I perſecuted the Church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was beſtowed upon me, was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly then they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me: Therefore whether it were I, or they, ſo we preach, and ſo ye believed.</p>

The Phariſee ſtood and prayed thus with himſelf, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjuſt, adulterers, or even as this Publican. I faſt twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I poſſeſs. And the Publican ſtanding afar off, would not lift up ſo much as his eyes unto heaven, but ſmote upon his breaſt, ſaying, God be merciful to me a ſinner. I tell you, this man went down to his houſe juſtified rather then the other: for every one that exalteth himſelf, ſhall be abaſed; and he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted.</p>

But ye have not ſo learned Chriſt: If ſo be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jeſus: That ye put off concerning the former converſation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful luſts; and be renewed in the ſpirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true holineſs. Wherefore putting away lying, ſpeak every man truth with his neighbour; for we are members one of another. Be ye angry and ſin not. Let not the

Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye ſee ſigns and wonders, ye will not believe. The noble man ſaith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.

And as he journeyed he came near Damaſcus and ſuddenly there ſhined round about him a light from heaven. And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice ſaying unto him, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? And he ſaid, who art thou, Lord? And the Lord ſaid, I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt: it is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks. And he trembling and aſtoniſhed, ſaid, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord ſaid unto him, Ariſe, and go into the city, and it ſhall be told thee what thou muſt do. And the men which journeyed with him ſtood ſpeechleſs, hearing a voice, but ſeeing no man. And Saul aroſe from the earth, and when his eyes were opened, he ſaw no man; but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damaſcus. And he was three days without ſight, and neither did eat nor drink. And there was a certain diſciple at Damaſcus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> named Ananias, and to him ſaid the Lord in

Then Ananias anſwered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy ſaints at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; and here he hath authority from the chief prieſts to bind all that call on thy Name.

And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been ſcales; and he received ſight forthwith, and aroſe, and was baptized. And when he had received meat, he was ſtrengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the diſciples which were at Damaſcus. And ſtraightway he preached Chriſt in the ſynagogues, that he is the Son of God.

                  <p>My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers temptations; knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience. But let patience have her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing. If any of you lack wiſdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given him. But let him ask in faith nothing wavering; for he that wavereth is like a wave of the ſea, driven with the wind, and toſſed. For let not that man think that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord. A dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-minded man is unſtable in all his ways. Let the brother of low degree rejoyce in that he is exalted; but the rich in that he is made low; becauſe as the flower of the graſs he ſhall paſs away. For the ſun is no ſooner riſen with a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat, but it withereth the graſs, and the flower there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of falleth, and the grace of the faſhion of it periſheth: ſo alſo ſhall the rich man fade away in his ways. Bleſſed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he is tryed, he ſhall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that love him.</p>

                  <p>THere was war in heaven: Michael and his Angels fought againſt the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels; and prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was caſt out, that old ſerpent, called the devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world; he was caſt out into the earth, and his angels were caſt out with him. And I heard a loud voice ſaying in heaven, Now is come ſalvation, and ſtrength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Chriſt: for the accuſer of our brethren is caſt down, which accuſed them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the bloud of the Lamb, and by the word of their teſtimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. Therefore rejoyce, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Wo to the inhabiters of the earth and of the ſea: for the devil is come down unto you, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving great wrath, becauſe he knoweth that he hath but a ſhort time.</p>

And Jeſus called a little child unto him, and ſet him in the midſt of them, and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whoſoever therefore ſhall humble himſelf as this little child, the ſame is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the kingdom of heaven. And whoſo ſhall receive one ſuch little child in my Name, receiveth me. But whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a milſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the ſea. Wo unto the world, becauſe of offences: for it muſt needs be that offences come; but wo to that man by whom the offence cometh. Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and caſt them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather then having two hands or two feet, to be caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting fire.

Wherefore it is our duty to render moſt humble and hearty thanks to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God our heavenly Father, for that he hath given his Son our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, not only to die for us, but alſo to be our ſpiritual food and ſuſtenance in that holy Sacrament. Which being ſo divine and comfortable a thing to them who receive it worthily, and ſo dangerous to them that will preſume to receive it unworthily; my duty is to exhort you in the mean ſeaſon to conſider the dignity of that holy Myſtery, and the great peril of the unworthy receiving thereof, and ſo to ſearch and examine your own conſciences, (and that not lightly, and after the manner of diſſemblers with God; but ſo) that ye may come holy and clean to ſuch a heavenly feaſt, in the marriage-garment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by God in holy Scripture, and be received as worthy partakers of that holy Table.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48041:88"/>
               <p> The way and means thereto is: Firſt, to examine your lives and converſations by the rule of Gods commandments; and whereinſoever ye ſhall perceive your ſelves to have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, either by will, word, or deed, there to bewail your own ſinfulneſs, and to confeſs your ſelves to Almighty God, with full purpoſe of amendment of life. And if ye ſhall perceive your offences to be ſuch as are not only againſt God, but alſo againſt your neighbours, then ye ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile your ſelves unto them, being ready to make reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and ſatisfaction according to the uttermoſt of your powers, for all injuries and wrongs done by you to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and being likewiſe ready to forgive others that have offended you, as ye would have forgiveneſs of your offences at Gods hand: for otherwiſe the receiving of the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion doth nothing elſe but increaſe your damnation. Therefore if any of you be a blaſphemer of God, an hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or ſlanderer of his Word, an adulterer, or be in malice, or envy, or in any other grievous crime; Repent you of your ſins, or elſe come not to that holy Table, leſt after the taking of that holy Sacrament, the devil enter imto you, as he entred into Judas, and fill you full of all iniquities, and bring you to deſtruction both of body and ſoul.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it is requiſite, that no man ſhould come to the holy Communion, but with a full truſt in Gods mercy, and with a quiet conſcience; therefore if there be any of you, who by this means cannot quiet his own conſcience herein, but required further comfort or counſel; let him come to me, or to ſome other diſcreet and learned Miniſter of Gods Word, and open his grief, that by the miniſtery of Gods holy Word he may receive the benefit of abſolution, together with ghoſtly counſel and advice, to the quieting of his conſcience, and avoiding of all ſcruple and doubtfulneſs.</p>

               <p>DEarly beloved brethren, on—I intend by Gods grace, to celebrate the Lords Supper: unto which in Gods behalf I bid you all that are here preſent, and beſeech you for the Lord Jeſus Chriſts ſake, that ye will not refuſe to come thereto, being ſo lovingly called and bidden by God himſelf. Ye know how grievous and unkind a thing it is, when a man hath prepared a rich feaſt, decked his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with all kind of proviſion, ſo that there lacketh nothing but the gueſts to ſit down, and yet they who are called (without any cauſe) moſt unthankfully refuſe to come.
<pb facs="tcp:48041:88"/> Which of you in ſuch a caſe would not be moved? Who would not think a great injury and wrong done unto him? Wherefore, moſt dearly beloved in Chriſt, take ye good heed, leſt ye withdrawing your ſelves from this holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, provoke Gods indignation againſt you. It is an eaſie matter for a man to ſay, I will not communicate, becauſe I am otherwiſe hindred with worldly buſineſs. But ſuch excuſes are not ſo eaſily accepted and allowed before God. If any man ſay, I am a grievous ſinner, and therefore am afraid to come: wherefore then do ye not repent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend? When God calleth you, are ye not aſhamed to ſay you will not come? When ye ſhould return to God, will ye excuſe your ſelves, and ſay ye are not ready? Conſider earneſtly with your ſelves, how little ſuch feigned excuſes will avail before God. They that refuſed the feaſt in the Goſpel, becauſe they had bought a farm, or would try their yokes of oxen, or becauſe they were married, were not ſo excuſed, but counted unworthy of the heavenly feaſt. I for my part ſhall be ready, and according to mine Office, I bid you in the Name of God, I call you in Chriſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, I exhort you, as you love your own ſalvation, that ye will be partakers of this holy Communion. And as the Son of God did vouchſafe to yield up his ſoul by death upon the croſs for your ſalvation: ſo it is your duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Communion, in remembrance of the ſacrifice of his death, as he himſelf hath commanded: Which if ye ſhall neglect to do, conſider with your ſelves how great injury ye do unto God, and how ſore puniſhment hangeth over your heads for the ſame; when ye wilfully abſtain from the Lords Table, and ſeparate from your brethren, who come to feed on the banquet of that moſt heavenly food. Theſe things if ye earneſtly conſider, ye will by Gods grace return to a better mind: for the obtaining whereof, we ſhall not ceaſe to make our humble petitions unto Almighty God our heavenly Father.</p>

For as the benefit is great, if with a true penitent
<pb facs="tcp:48041:89"/> heart and lively faith we receive that holy Sacrament (for then we ſpiritually eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and drink his bloud; then we dwell in Chriſt, and Chriſt in us; we are one with Chriſt, and Chriſt with us:) So is the danger great, if we receive the ſame unworthily. For then we are guilty of the body and bloud of Chriſt our Saviour; we eat and drink our own damnation, not conſidering the Lords body; we kindle Gods wrath againſt us; we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to plague us with divers diſeaſes, and ſundry kinds of death. Judge therefore your ſelves, brethren, that ye be not judged of the Lord; repent you truly for your ſins paſt; have a lively and ſtedfaſt faith in Chriſt our Saviour; amend your lives, and be in perfect charity with all men, ſo ſhall ye be meet partakers of thoſe holy Myſteries. And above all things ye muſt give moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and hearty thanks to God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, for the redemption of the world by the death and paſſion of our Saviour Chriſt, both God and man, who did humble himſelf even to the death upon the Croſs, for us miſerable ſinners, who lay in darkneſs and the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death, that he might make us the children of God, and exalt us to everlaſting life. And to the end that we ſhould alway remember the exceeding great love of our Maſter, and only Saviour, Jeſus Chriſt, thus dying for us, and the innumerable benefits which by his precious bloud-ſhedding he hath obtained to us; he hath inſtituted and ordained holy Myſteries, as pledges of his love, and for a continual remembrance of his death, to our great and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs comfort.

            </p>
            <p>Hear the words of the Goſpel, written by Saint Mark, in the Tenth Chapter, at the Thirteenth Verſe.</p>
            <p>THey brought young children to Chriſt, that he ſhould touch them; and his diſciples rebuked thoſe that brought them. But when Jeſus ſaw it, he was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, and ſaid unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God. Verily I ſay unto you, Whoſoever ſhall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little child, he ſhall not enter therein. And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and bleſſed them.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>After the Goſpel is read, the Miniſter ſhall make this brief Exhortation upon the words of the Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BEloved, ye hear in this Goſpel the words of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, that he commanded the children to be brought unto him; how he blamed thoſe that would have kept than from him; how he exhorteth all men to follow their innocency. Ye perceive how by his outward geſture and deed he declared his good will toward them; for he embraced them in his arms, he laid his hands upon them, and bleſſed them. Doubt ye not therefore, but earneſtly believe, that he will likewiſe favourably receive <hi>this</hi> preſent <hi>Infant,</hi> that he will embrace <hi>him</hi> with the arms of his mercy, that he will give unto <hi>him</hi> the bleſſing of eternal life, and make <hi>him partaker</hi> of his everlaſting Kingdom. Wherefore we being thus perſwaded of the good will of our heavenly Father towards <hi>this Infant,</hi> declared by his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and nothing doubting but that he favourably alloweth this charitable work of ours, in bringing <hi>this Infant</hi> to his holy Baptiſm, let us faithfully and devoutly give thanks unto him, and ſay,</p>
            <p>ALmighty and everlaſting God, heavenly Father, we give thee humble thanks, that thou haſt vouchſafed to call us to the Knowledge of thy grace and faith in thee: Increaſe this knowledge, and confirm this faith in us evermore. Give thy holy Spirit to <hi>this Infant,</hi> that <hi>he</hi> may be born again, and be made <hi>an heir</hi> of everlaſting Salvation, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Ye have heard alſo that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath promiſed in his Goſpel to grant all theſe things that ye have prayed for: which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe he for his part will moſt ſurely keep and perform. Wherefore after this promiſe made by Chriſt, <hi>this Infant</hi> muſt alſo faithfully for <hi>his</hi> part, promiſe by you that are <hi>his</hi> Sureties, (until <hi>he</hi> come of age to take it upon <hi>himſelf</hi>) that <hi>he</hi> will renounce the devil and all his works, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly believe Gods holy word, and obediently keep his commandments.</p>

And that he was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt; born of the Virgin Mary; that he ſuffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried; that he went down into hell, and alſo did riſe again the third day; that he aſcended into Heaven, and ſitteth at the right hand of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Almighty; and from thence ſhall come again at the end of the world, to judge the quick and the dead?</p>
               <p>And doſt thou believe in the Holy Ghoſt; the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; the Communion of Saints; the remiſſion of ſins; the reſurrection of the fleſh; and everlaſting life after death?</p>

            <p>ALmighty everliving God, whoſe moſt dearly beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt for the forgiveneſs of our ſins, did ſhed out of his moſt precious ſide both water and bloud, and gave commandment to his diſciples, that they ſhould go teach all Nations, and baptize them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; Regard, we beſeech thee, the ſupplications of thy Congregation; ſanctifie this Water to the myſtical waſting away of ſin: and grant that <hi>this Child</hi> now to be baptized therein, may receive the fulneſs of thy grace, and ever remain in the number of thy faithful and elect children, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>I Certifie you, that in this caſe all is well done, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto due order, concerning the Baptizing of this child; who being born in original ſin, and in the wrath of God, is now by the laver of Regeneration in Baptiſm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the number of the children of God, and heirs of everlaſting life: For our Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth not deny his grace and mercy unto ſuch Infants, but moſt lovingly doth call them unto him, as the holy Goſpel doth witneſs to our comfort on this wiſe.</p>

               <p>THey brought young children to Chriſt, that he ſhould touch them; and his diſciples rebuked thoſe that brought them. But when Jeſus ſaw it, he was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed, and ſaid unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not; for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God.

               <p>¶ <hi>After the Goſpel is read, the Miniſter ſhall make this brief Exhortation upon the words of the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BEloved, ye hear in this Goſpel the words of our Saviour Chriſt, that he commanded the children to be brought unto him; how he blamed thoſe that would have kept them from him; how he exhorted all men to follow their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. Ye perceive how by his outward geſture and deed he declared his good will toward them; for he embraced them in his arms, he laid his hands upon them, and bleſſed them. Doubt ye not therefore, but earneſtly believe, that he hath likewiſe favourably received this preſent Infant, that he hath embraced <hi>him</hi> with the arms of his mercy, and (as he hath promiſed in his holy Word) will give unto <hi>him</hi> the the bleſſing of eternal life, and make <hi>him</hi> partaker of his everlaſting Kingdom. Wherefore we being thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the good will of our heavenly Father, declared by his Son Jeſus Chriſt towards this Infant, let us faithfully and devoutly give thanks unto him, and ſay the Prayer which the Lord himſelf taught us.</p>
               <p>OUr Father, which art in Heaven; Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our treſpaſſes, As we forgive them that treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs againſt us. And lead us not into temptation; But deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from evil. Amen.</p>
               <p>ALmighty and everlaſting God, heavenly Father, we give thee humble thanks, that thou haſt vouchſafed to call us to the knowledge of thy grace and faith in thee; Increaſe this knowledge, and confirm this faith in us evermore. Give thy holy Spirit to this Infant, that <hi>he</hi> being born again, and being made an heir of everlaſting Salvation, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, may continue thy ſervant, and attain thy

               <p>WE yield thee moſt hearty thanks, moſt merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it hath pleaſed thee to regenerate <hi>this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant</hi> with thy holy Spirit, to receive <hi>him</hi> for thine own <hi>Child</hi> by adoption, and to incorporate <hi>him</hi> into thy holy Church. And humbly we beſeech thee to grant, that <hi>he</hi> being dead unto ſin, and living unto righteouſneſs, and being buried with Chriſt in his Death, may crucifie the old man, and utterly aboliſh the whole body of ſin, and that as <hi>he is</hi> made partaker of the Death of thy Son, <hi>he</hi> may alſo be <hi>partaker</hi> of his Reſurrection; ſo that finally with the reſidue of thy holy Church, <hi>he</hi> may be <hi>an Inheritour</hi> of thine everlaſting Kingdom, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>¶ <hi>Then all ſtanding up, the Miniſter ſhall make this Exhortation to the Godfathers and Godmothers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FOraſmuch as this child hath promiſed by you <hi>his</hi> Sureties, to renounce the devil and all his works, to believe in God, and to ſerve him; ye muſt remember that it is your parts and duties to ſee that this Infant be taught, ſo ſoon as <hi>he</hi> ſhall be able to learn what a ſolemn vow, promiſe and profeſſion <hi>he</hi> hath made by you. And that <hi>he</hi> may know theſe things the better, ye ſhall call upon <hi>him</hi> to hear Sermons, and chiefly ye ſhall provide that <hi>he</hi> may learn the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the Ten Commandments in the vulgar tongue, and all other things which a Chriſtian ought to know and believe to his ſouls health; and that this child may be virtuouſly brought up to lead a Godly and a Chriſtian life; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring alway, that Baptiſm doth repreſent unto us our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, which is to follow the example of our Saviour Chriſt, and be made like unto him; that as he died and roſe again for us, ſo ſhould we who are Baptized, die from ſin, and riſe again unto righteouſneſs, continually mortifying all our evil and corrupt affections and daily proceeding in all virtue and godlineſs of living.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Hear the words of the Goſpel written by Saint John, in the third Chapter, beginning at the firſt Verſe.</p>
            <p>THere was a man of the Phariſees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. The ſame came to Jeſus by night, and ſaid unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher come from God; for no man can do theſe miracles that thou doeſt, except God be with him. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God. Nicodemus ſaith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the ſecond time into his mothers womb, and be born? Jeſus anſwered, Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is ſpirit. Marvel not that I ſaid unto thee, Ye muſt be born again. The wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof; but canſt not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: ſo is every one that is born of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>After which he ſhall ſay this Exhortation following.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BEloved, ye hear in this Goſpel the expreſs words of our Saviour Chriſt, that except a man be born of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. Whereby ye may perceive the great neceſſity of this Sacrament, where it may be had. Likewiſe immediately
<pb facs="tcp:48041:99"/> before his Aſcenſion into Heaven (as we read in the laſt Chapter of Saint Marks Goſpel,) he gave command to his diſciples, ſaying, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature. He that believeth and is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned. Which alſo ſheweth unto us the great benefit we reap thereby. For which cauſe Saint Peter the Apoſtle, when upon his firſt preaching of the Goſpel many were prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the heart, and ſaid to him and the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Men, and brethren, what ſhall we do? replied and ſaid unto them, Repent and be baptized every one of you for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt. For the promiſe is to you and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God ſhall call. And with many other words exhorted he them, ſaying, Save your ſelves from this untoward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. For (as the ſame Apoſtle teſtifieth in another place) even Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us, (not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh, but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God) by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt. Doubt ye not therefore, but earneſtly believe that he will favourable receive <hi>theſe</hi> preſent <hi>perſons,</hi> truly repenting and coming unto him by faith; that he will grant <hi>them</hi> remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>their</hi> ſins, and beſtow upon <hi>them</hi> the Holy Ghoſt; that he will give <hi>them</hi> the bleſſing of eternal life, and make <hi>them partakers</hi> of his everlaſting Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we being thus perſwaded of the good will of our heavenly Father towards <hi>theſe perſons,</hi> declared by his Son Jeſus Chriſt, let us faithfully and devoutly give thanks to him, and ſay,</p>
            <p>ALmighty and everlaſting God, heavenly Father, we give thee humble thanks, for that thou haſt vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to call us to the knowledge of thy grace and faith in thee; Increaſe this knowledge, and confirm this faith in us evermore: Give thy holy Spirit to <hi>theſe perſons,</hi> that <hi>they</hi> may be born again, and be made <hi>heirs</hi> of everlaſting ſalvation, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the holy Spirit, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>Wherefore after this promiſe made by Chriſt, <hi>ye</hi> muſt alſo faithfully for your part promiſe in the preſence of theſe your Witneſſes, and this whole Congregation, that <hi>ye</hi> will renounce the devil and all his works, and conſtantly believe Gods holy Word, and obediently keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

            <p>ALmighty everliving God, whoſe moſt dearly beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt, for the forgiveneſs of our ſins, did ſhed out of his moſt precious ſide both water and bloud, and give commandment to his diſciples, that they ſhould go teach all Nations, and baptize them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt; Regard, we beſeech thee, the ſupplications of this Congregation; ſanctifie this Water to the myſtical waſhing away of ſin: and grant that <hi>the perſons</hi> now to be baptized therein, may receive the fulneſs of thy grace, and ever remain in the number of thy faithful and elect children, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Then ſhall the Prieſt take each perſon to be Baptized, by the right hand, and placing him conveniently by the Font, according to his diſcretion, ſhall ask the Godfathers and Godmothers the Name; and then ſhall dip him in the water, or pour water upon him, ſaying,</hi>

            <p>SEeing now, dearly beloved brethren, that <hi>theſe perſons are</hi> regenerate and grafted into the body of Chriſts Church, let us give thanks unto Almighty God for theſe benefits, and with one accord make our prayers unto him, that <hi>they</hi> may lead the reſt of <hi>their</hi> life according to this beginning.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Then ſhall be ſaid the Lords Prayer, all kneeling,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUr Father which art in Heaven; Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our treſpaſſes, As we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us. And lead us not into temptation; But deliver us from evil. Amen.</p>
            <p>WE yield thee humble thanks, O heavenly Father, that thou haſt vouchſafed to call us to the knowledge of thy grace and faith in thee; Increaſe this knowledge, and confirm this faith in us evermore. Give thy holy Spirit to <hi>theſe perſons,</hi> that being now born again, and made <hi>heirs</hi> of everlaſting ſalvation though our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>they</hi> may continue thy <hi>ſervants,</hi> and attain thy promiſes, through the ſame Lord Jeſus Chriſt thy Son, who liveth and reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with thee in the unity of the ſame holy Spirit ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Then all ſtanding up, the Prieſt ſhall uſe this Exhortation following; ſpeaking to the Godfathers and Godmothers firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOraſmuch as <hi>theſe perſons</hi> have promiſed in your preſence, to renounce the devil and all his works, to believe in God, and to ſerve him; ye muſt remember that it is your part and duty to put <hi>them</hi> in mind what a ſolemn vow, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and profeſſion <hi>they have</hi> now made before this Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eſpecially before you <hi>their</hi> choſen Witneſſes. And ye are alſo to call upon <hi>them</hi> to uſe all diligence to be rightly inſtructed in Gods holy Word, that ſo <hi>they</hi> may grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and live godly, righteouſly, and ſoberly in this preſent world.</p>
            <p>(¶ <hi>And then ſpeaking to the new Baptized Perſons, he ſhall proceed, and ſay,</hi>)</p>
            <p>ANd as for you, who have now by Baptiſm put on Chriſt, it is your part and duty alſo, being made the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, and of the light by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, to walk anſwerably to your Chriſtian calling, and as becometh the children of light: remembring always that Baptiſm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth unto us our profeſſion; which is, to follow the example of our Saviour Chriſt, and to be made like unto
<pb facs="tcp:48041:101"/> him; that as he died, and roſe again for us; ſo ſhould we who are baptized, die from ſin, and riſe again unto righteouſneſs, continually mortifying all our evil and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections, and daily proceeding in all virtue and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of living.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>It is expedient that every Perſon thus Baptized ſhould be confirmed by the Biſhop ſo ſoon after his Baptiſm as conveniently may be; that ſo he may be admitted to the holy Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>If any Perſons not Baptized in their infancy, ſhall be brought to be Baptized before they come to years of diſcretion to anſwer for themſelves; it may ſuffice to uſe the Office for Publick Baptiſm of Infants, or (in caſe of extream danger) the Office for Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Baptiſm, only changing the word</hi> [Infant] <hi>for</hi> [Child <hi>or</hi> Perſon] <hi>as occaſion requireth.</hi>

Thou ſhalt not bowe down to them, nor worſhip them. For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, and viſit the ſins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and ſhew mercy unto thouſands in them that love me, and keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>

               <p>O God of Abraham, God of Iſaac, God of Jacob, bleſs theſe thy ſervants, and ſow the ſeed of eternal life in their hearts, that whatſoever in thy holy Word they ſhall profitably learn, they may indeed fulfil the ſame. Look, O Lord, mercifully upon them from heaven, and bleſs them. And as thou didſt ſend thy bleſſing upon Abraham and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, to their great comfort; ſo vouchſafe to ſend thy bleſſing upon theſe thy ſervants, that they obeying thy will, and alway being in ſafety under thy protection, may abide in thy love unto their lives end, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>O Merciful Lord and heavenly Father, By whoſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious gift mankind is increaſed; We beſeech thee aſſiſt with thy bleſſing theſe two perſons, that they may both be fruitful in procreation of Children, and alſo live together ſo long in godly love and honeſty, that they may ſee their children Chriſtianly and virtuouſly brought up to thy praiſe and honour, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O God, who by thy mighty power haſt made all things of nothing, who alſo (after other things ſet in order) didſt appoint that out of Man (created after thine own image and ſimilitude) Woman ſhould take her beginning; and knitting them together, didſt teach that it ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be lawful to put aſunder thoſe whom thou by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony hadſt made one: O God, who haſt conſecrated the ſtate of Matrimony to ſuch an excellent Myſtery, that in it is ſignified and repreſented the ſpiritual marriage and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betwixt Chriſt and his Church; Look mercifully upon theſe thy ſervants, that both this Man may love his wife according to thy Word, (as Chriſt did love his ſpouſe the Church, who gave himſelf for it, loving and cheriſhing it even as his own fleſh) and alſo that this Woman may be loving and amiable, faithful and obedient to her Husband, and in all quietneſs, ſobriety and peace, be a follower of holy and godly Matrons. O Lord, bleſs them both, and grant them to inherit thy everlaſting Kingdom, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Then ſhall the Prieſt ſay,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALmighty God, who at the beginning did create our firſt parents, Adam and Eve, and did ſanctifie and joyn them together in Marriage; Pour upon you the riches of his grace, ſanctifie and bleſs you, that ye may pleaſe him both in body and ſoul, and live together in holy love unto your lives end. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ After which, if there be no Sermon declaring the Duties of Man and Wife, the Miniſter ſhall read as followeth.</p>
            <p>ALl ye that are married, or that intend to take the holy Eſtate of Matrimony upon you, hear what the holy Scripture doth ſay as touching the Duty of Husbands towards their Wives, and Wives towards their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</p>
            <p>Saint Paul in his Epiſtle to the Epheſians, the Fifth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,
<pb facs="tcp:48041:108"/> doth give this commandment to all married Men, Husbands, love your Wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water, by the Word; that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing; but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies: He that loved his wife, loveth himſelf. For no man ever yet hateth his own fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, even as the Lord the Church: For we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones. For this cauſe ſhall a man leave his father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſhall be joyned unto his wife, and they two ſhall be one fleſh. This is a great myſtery; but I ſpeak concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt and the Church. Nevertheleſs, let every one of you in particular, ſo love his wife, even as himſelf. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe the ſame Saint Paul writing to the Coloſſians, ſpeaketh thus to all men that are married, Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter againſt them. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.19.</p>
            <p>Hear alſo what Saint Peter the Apoſtle of Chriſt, who was himſelf a married a man, ſaith unto them that are married, Ye husbands, dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker veſſel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindred. 1 S. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7.</p>
            <p>Hitherto ye have heard the duty of the husband toward the wife. Now likewiſe, ye wives, hear and learn your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties toward your husbands, even as it is plainly ſet forth in holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>Saint Paul in the aforenamed Epiſtle to the Epheſians, teacheth you thus; Wives, ſubmit your ſelves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Chriſt is the head of the Church: and he is the Saviour of the body. Therefore as the Church is ſubject unto Chriſt, ſo let the wives be to their own huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in every thing. And again he ſaith, Let the wife ſee that ſhe reverence her husband. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.22.</p>
            <p>And in his Epiſtle to the Coloſſians, Saint Paul giveth you this ſhort leſſon, Wives, ſubmit your ſelves unto your own husbands, as is it fit the Lord. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.18.</p>
            <p>Saint Peter alſo doth inſtruct you very well, thus ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Ye wives, be in ſubjection to your own husbands; that if any obey not the word, they alſo may without the word
<pb facs="tcp:48041:108"/> be won by the converſation of the wives; while they behold your chaſte converſation coupled with fear. Whoſe adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price. For after this manner in the old time the holy women alſo who truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in God, adorned themſelves, being in ſubjection unto their own husbands; even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him Lord; whoſe daughters ye are as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement. 1 <hi>S. Pet.</hi> 3.1.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>It is convenient that the new married Perſons ſhould receive the holy Communion at the time of their Marriage, or at the firſt opportunity after their Marriage.</hi>

            <p>¶ <hi>Then ſhall the Miniſter exhort the ſick Perſon after this form, or other like.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DEarly beloved, know this, that Almighty God is the Lord of life and death, and of all things to them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, as youth, ſtrength, health, age, weakneſs, and ſickneſs. Wherefore whatſoever your ſickneſs is, know you certainly that it is Gods viſitation. And for what cauſe ſoever this ſickneſs is ſent unto you, whether it be to try your patience for the example of others, and that your faith may be found in the day of the Lord, laudable, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and honourable, to the increaſe of glory and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs felicity; or elſe it be ſent unto you to correct and amend in you whatſoever doth offend the eyes of your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father; know you certainly, that if you truly repent you of your ſins and bear your ſickneſs patiently, truſting in Gods mercy, for his dear Son Jeſus Chriſts ſake, and render unto him humble thanks for his Fatherly viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſubmitting your ſelf wholly unto his will, it ſhall turn to your profit, and help you forward in the right way that leadeth unto everlaſting life.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:48041:109"/>
            <p> ¶ <hi>If the Perſon viſited be very ſick, then the Curate may end his Exhortation in this place, or elſe proceed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TAke therefore in good part the chaſtiſement of the Lord: For (as Saint Paul ſaith in the twelfth Chapter to the Hebrews) whom the Lord loveth he chaſtneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth. If ye endure chaſtning, God dealeth with you as with ſons; for what ſon is he whom the Father chaſtneth not? But if ye be without chaſtiſement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye baſtards, and not ſons. Furthermore, we have had fathers of our fleſh, which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto the Father of Spirits, and live? For they verily for a few days chaſtned us after their own pleaſure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Theſe words, good <hi>brother,</hi> are written in holy Scripture for our comfort and inſtruction, that we ſhould patiently, and with thankſgiving bear our heavenly Fathers correction, whenſoever by any manner of adverſity it ſhall pleaſe his gracious goodneſs to viſit us. And there ſhould be no greater comfort to Chriſtian perſons, then to be made like unto Chriſt, by ſuffering patiently adverſities, troubles, and ſickneſſes. For he himſelf went not up to joy, but firſt he ſuffered pain; he entred not into his glory before he was crucified. So truly our way to eternal joy, is to ſuffer here with Chriſt; and our door to enter into eternal life, is gladly to die with Chriſt; that we may riſe again from death, and dwell with him in everlaſting life. Now therefore taking your ſickneſs, which is thus profitable for you, patiently, I exhort you in the Name of God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the profeſſion which you made unto God in your Baptiſm. And for as much as after this life there is an account to be given unto the righteous Judge, by whom all muſt be judged without reſpect of perſons; I require you to examine your ſelf and your eſtate, both toward God and man; ſo that accuſing and condemning your ſelf for your own fault, you may find mercy at our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Fathers hand for Chriſts ſake, and not be accuſed and condemned in that fearful judgment. Therefore I ſhall rehearſe to you the Articles of our Faith, that you may know whether you do believe as a Chriſtian man ſhould, or no.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:48041:110"/>
            <p> ¶ <hi>Here the Miniſter ſhall rehearſe the Articles of the Faith, ſaying thus,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>DOſt thou believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth?</p>
            <p>And in Jeſus Chriſt his only begotten Son our Lord? And that he was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt; born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary; that he ſuffered under Pontius Pilate, was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, dead and buried; that he went down into hell, and alſo did riſe again the third day; that he aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſitteth at the right hand of God the Father Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; and from thence ſhall come again at the end of the world, to judge the quick and the dead?</p>
            <p>And doſt thou believe in the Holy Ghoſt; the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church; the Communion of Saints; the remiſſion of ſins; the reſurrection of the fleſh; and everlaſting life after death?</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>The ſick Perſon ſhall anſwer,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this I ſtedfaſtly believe.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Then ſhall the Miniſter examine whether he repent him truly of his ſins, and be in charity with all the world; exhorting him to forgive from the bottom of his heart all Perſons that have offended him, and if he hath offended any other, to ask them forgiveneſs; and where he hath done injury or wrong to any man, that he make amends to the uttermoſt of his power. And if he hath not before diſpoſed of his Goods, let him then be admoniſhed to make his Will, and to declare his Debts, what he oweth, and what is owing unto him, for the better diſcharging of his conſcience, and the quietneſs of his Executors. But men ſhould often be put in remembrance to take order for the ſettling of their temporal Eſtates, whilſt they are in health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Theſe words before rehearſed, may be ſaid before the Miniſter begin his Prayer, as he ſhall ſee cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>The Miniſter ſhould not omit earneſtly to move ſuch ſick Perſons as are of ability, to be liberal to the Poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Here ſhall the ſick Perſon be moved to make a ſpecial confeſſion of his ſins, if he feel his conſcience troubled with any weighty matter. After which confeſſion, the Prieſt ſhall abſolve him (if he humbly and heartily deſire it) after this ſort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUr Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath left power to his Church to abſolve all ſinners who truly repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, of his great mercy forgive thee thine offences: And by his Authority committed to me, I abſolve thee from all thy ſins, In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt. Amen.</p>
            <p>¶ <hi>And then the Prieſt ſhall ſay the Collect following.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us pray.</p>
            <p>O Moſt merciful God, who according to the multitude of thy mercies, doſt ſo put away the ſins of thoſe who truly repent, that thou remembreſt them no more; Open thine eye of mercy upon this thy ſervant, who moſt earneſtly deſireth pardon and forgiveneſs. Renew in <hi>him</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48041:110"/> (moſt loving Father) whatſoever hath been decayed by the fraud and malice of the devil, or by <hi>his</hi> own carnal will and frailneſs; preſerve and continue this ſick member in the unity of the Church; conſider <hi>his</hi> contrition, accept <hi>his</hi> tears, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage <hi>his</hi> pain, as ſhall ſeem to thee moſt expedient for <hi>him.</hi> And foraſmuch as <hi>he</hi> putteth <hi>his</hi> full truſt only in thy mercy, impute not unto <hi>him his</hi> former ſins; but ſtrengthen <hi>him</hi> with thy bleſſed Spirit; and when thou art plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to take <hi>him</hi> hence, take <hi>him</hi> unto thy favour, through the merits of thy moſt dearly beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>Then ſhall the Miniſter ſay this Pſalm. In te, Domine, ſperavi.</hi> Pſal. 71.</p>
            <p>IN thee, O Lord, have I put my truſt, let me never be put to confuſion: but rid me, and deliver me in thy righteouſneſs; incline thine ear unto me, and ſave me.</p>
            <p>Be thou my ſtrong hold, whereunto I may alway reſort: thou haſt promiſed to help me, for thou art my houſe of defence, and my caſtle.</p>
            <p>Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</p>
            <p>For thou, O Lord God, art the thing that I long for: thou art my hope, even from my youth.</p>

               <p>NOw is Chriſt riſen from the dead, and become the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept. For ſince by man came death, by man came alſo the reſurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Chriſt the firſt-fruits; afterward they that are Chriſts, at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he ſhall have put down all rule, and all authority and power. For he muſt reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death: For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he ſaith all things are put under him, it is manifeſt that he is excepted which did put all things under him. And when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, then ſhall the Son also himſelf be ſubject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. Elſe what ſhall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead riſe not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead? And why ſtand we in jeopardy every hour? I proteſt by your rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing which I have in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, I die daily. If after the manner of men I have fought with beaſt at Epheſus, what advantageth it me, if the dead riſe not? Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die. Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; evil communications corrupt good manners. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake to righteouſneſs, and ſin not; for ſome have not the knowledge of God. I ſpeak this to your ſhame. But ſome man will ſay, how are the dead raiſed up? And with what body do they come? Thou fool, that which thou ſoweſt is not quickned except it die. And that which thou ſoweſt, thou ſoweſt not that body that ſhall be but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of ſome other grain. But God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it a body, as it hath pleaſed him, and to every ſeed his own body. All fleſh is not the ſame fleſh, but there is one

So alſo is the reſurrection of the dead; It is ſown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: It is ſown in diſhonour; it is raiſed in glory: It is ſown in weakneſs; it is raiſed in power: It is ſown a natural body; it is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a ſpiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a ſpiritual body. And ſo it is written, The firſt man Adam was made a living ſoul, the laſt Adam was made a quickning Spirit. Howbeit, that was not firſt which is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; but that which is natural, and afterward that which is ſpiritual. The firſt man is of the earth, earthy: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, ſuch are they that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, ſuch are they alſo that are heavenly. And as we have born the image of the earthy, we ſhall alſo bear the image of the heavenly. Now this I ſay, brethren, that fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I ſhew you a myſtery. We ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt trump; (for the trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible, and we ſhall be changed.) For this corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible muſt put on incorruption, and this mortal muſt put on immortality. So when this corruptible ſhall have put on incorruption, and this mortal ſhall have put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is written, Death is ſwallowed up in victory. O Death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the law. But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</p>

                  <p>25 My fleſh and my heart faileth: but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</p>
                  <p>26 For lo, they that forſake thee, ſhall periſh: thou haſt deſtroyed all them that commit fornication againſt thee.</p>

                  <p>HEar my law, O my people: incline your ears unto the words of my mouth.</p>
                  <p>2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will declare hand ſentences of old;</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48041:152"/>
                  <p> 3 Which we have heard and known: and ſuch as our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have told us;</p>
                  <p>4 That we ſhould not hide them from the children of the generations to come: but to ſhew the honour of the Lord, his mighty and wonderful works that he hath done.</p>
                  <p>5 He made a covenant with Jacob, and gave Iſrael a law: which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children;</p>
                  <p>6 That their poſterity might know it: and the children which were yet unborn;</p>
                  <p>7 To the intent, that when they came up: they might ſhew their children the ſame;</p>
                  <p>8 That they might put their truſt in God: and not to forget the works of God, but to keep his commandments;</p>
                  <p>9 And not to be as their forefathers, a faithleſs and ſtubborn generation: a generation that ſet not their heart aright, and whoſe ſpirit cleaveth not ſtedfaſtly unto God;</p>
                  <p>10 Like as the children of Ephraim: who being harneſſed and carrying bows, turned themſelves back in the day of battel.</p>
                  <p>11 They kept not the covenant of God: and would not walk in his law;</p>
                  <p>12 But forgat what he had done: and the wonderful works that he had ſhewed for them.</p>
                  <p>13 Marvellous things did he in the ſight of our forefathers, in the land of Egypt: even in the field of Zoan.</p>
                  <p>14 He divided the ſea, and let them go through: he made the waters to ſtand on an heap.</p>
                  <p>15 In the day-time alſo he led them with a cloud: and all the night through with a light of fire.</p>
                  <p>16 He clave the hard rocks in the wilderneſs: and gave them drink thereof, as it had been out of the great depth.</p>
                  <p>17 He brought waters out of the ſtony rock: ſo that it guſhed out like the rivers.</p>
                  <p>18 Yet for all this they ſinned more againſt him: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the moſt Higheſt in the wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p>19 They tempted God in their hearts: and required meat for their luſt.</p>
                  <p>20 They ſpake againſt God alſo, ſaying: Shall God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a table in the wilderneſs?</p>
                  <p>21 He ſmote the ſtony rock indeed, that the water guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and the ſtreams flowed withal: but can he give bread alſo, or provide fleſh for his people?</p>
                  <p>22 When the Lord heard this, he was wroth: ſo the fire was kindled in Jacob, and there came up heavy diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Iſrael;</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48041:153"/>
                  <p> 23 Becauſe: they believed not in God: and put not their truſt in his help.</p>
                  <p>24 So he commanded the clouds above: and opened the doors of heaven.</p>
                  <p>25 He rained down Manna alſo upon them for to eat: and gave them food from heaven.</p>
                  <p>26 So man did eat angels food: for he ſent them meat enough.</p>
                  <p>27 He cauſed the eaſt-wind to blow under heaven: and through his power he brought in the ſouth-weſt-wind.</p>
                  <p>28 He rained fleſh upon them as thick as duſt: and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered fowls like as the ſand of the ſea.</p>
                  <p>29 He let it fall among their tents: even round about their habitation.</p>
                  <p>30 So they did eat, and were well filled, for he gave them their own deſire: they were not diſappointed of their luſt.</p>
                  <p>31 But while the meat was yet in their mouths, the heavy wrath of God came upon them, and ſlew the wealthieſt of them: yea, and ſmote down the choſen men that were in Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>32 But for all this they ſinned yet more: and believed not his wondrous works.</p>
                  <p>33 Therefore their days did he conſume in vanity: and their years in trouble.</p>
                  <p>34 When he ſlew them, they ſought him: and turned them early, and enquired after God.</p>
                  <p>35 And they remembred that God was their ſtrength: and that the high God was their Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>36 Nevertheleſs, they did but flatter him with their mouth: and diſſemble with him in their tongue.</p>
                  <p>37 For their heart was not whole with him: neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued they ſtedfaſt in his covenant.</p>
                  <p>38 But he was ſo merciful, that he forgave their miſdeeds: and deſtroyed them not.</p>
                  <p>39 Yea, many a time turned he his wrath away: and would not ſuffer his whole diſpleaſure to ariſe.</p>
                  <p>40 For he conſidered that they were but fleſh: and that they were even a wind: that paſſeth away, and cometh not again.</p>
                  <p>41 Many a time did they provoke him in the wilderneſs: and grieved him in the deſert.</p>
                  <p>42 They turned back and tempted God: and moved the holy One in Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>43 They thought not of his hand: and of the day when he delivered them from the hand of the enemy;</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48041:153"/>
                  <p> 44 How he had wrought his miracles in Egypt: and his wonders in the field of Zoan.</p>
                  <p>45 He turned their waters into bloud: ſo that they might not drink of the rivers.</p>
                  <p>46 He ſent lice among them, and devoured them up: and frogs to deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>47 He gave their fruit unto the caterpillar: and the labour unto the graſhopper.</p>
                  <p>48 He deſtroyed their vines with hail-ſtones: and their mulberry-trees with the froſt.</p>
                  <p>49 He ſmote their cattel alſo with hail-ſtones: and their flocks with hot thunder-bolts.</p>
                  <p>50 He caſt upon them the furiouſneſs of his wrath, anger, diſpleaſure and trouble: and ſent evil angels among them.</p>
                  <p>51 He made a way to his indignation, and ſpared not their ſoul from death; but gave their life over to the peſtilence.</p>
                  <p>52 And ſmote all the firſt-born in Egypt: the moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and mightieſt in the dwellings of Ham.</p>
                  <p>53 But as for his own people, he led them forth like ſheep: and carried them in the wilderneſs like a flock.</p>
                  <p>54 He brought them out ſafely, that they ſhould not fear: and overwhelmed their enemies with the ſea.</p>
                  <p>55 And brought them within the borders of his ſanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary: even to his mountain which he purchaſed with his right hand.</p>
                  <p>56 He caſt out the heathen alſo before them: cauſed their land to be divided among them for an heritage, and made the tribes of Iſrael to dwell in their tents.</p>
                  <p>57 So they tempted and diſpleaſed the moſt high God: and kept not his teſtimonies;</p>
                  <p>58 But turned their backs, and fell away like their fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: ſtarting a ſide like a broken bow.</p>
                  <p>59 For they grieved him with their hill-altars: and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him to diſpleaſure with their images.</p>
                  <p>60 When God heard this, he was wroth: and took ſore diſpleaſure at Iſrael;</p>
                  <p>61 So that he forſook the tabernacle in Silo: even the tent that he had pitched among men.</p>
                  <p>62 He delivered their power into captivity: and their beauty into the enemies hand.</p>
                  <p>63 He gave his people over alſo unto the ſword: and was wroth with his inheritance.</p>
                  <p>64 The fire conſumed their young men: and their maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens were not given to marriage.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48041:154"/>
                  <p> 65 Their prieſts were ſlain with the ſword: and there were no widows to make lamentation.<note place="margin">DAY xvi.</note>
                  </p>

                  <p>67 He ſmote his enemies in the hinder parts: and put them to a perpetual ſhame.</p>
                  <p>68 He refuſed the tabernacle of Joſeph: and choſe not the tribe of Ephraim;</p>
                  <p>69 But choſe the tribe of Juda: even the hill of Sion which he loved.</p>
                  <p>70 And there he built his temple on high: and laid the foundation of it like the ground which he hath made conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually.</p>
                  <p>71 He choſe David alſo his ſervant: and took him away from the ſheep-folds.</p>
                  <p>72 As he was following the ews great with young ones he took him: that he might feed Jacob his people, and Iſrael his inheritance.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>YOu have heard, brethren, as well in your private examination, as in the exhortation which was now made to you, and in the holy Leſſons taken out of the Goſpel, and the Writings of the Apoſtles, of what dignity, and of how great importance this Office is, whereunto ye are called. And now again we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you have in remembrance into how high a Dignity, and to how weighty an Office and Charge ye are called: That is to ſay, to be Meſſengers, Watchmen, and Stewards of the Lord; to teach and to premoniſh, to feed and provide for the Lords family; to ſeek for Chriſts ſheep that are diſperſed abroad, and for his children who are in the midſt of this naughty world, that they may be ſaved through Chriſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>Have always therefore printed in your remembrance, how great a treaſure is committed to your charge. For they are the ſheep of Chriſt, which he bought with his death, and for whom he ſhed his bloud. The Church and Congregation whom you muſt ſerve, is his Spouſe, and his Body. And if it ſhall happen the ſame Church, or any member thereof, to take any hurt or hindrance by reaſon of your negligence, ye know the greatneſs of the fault, and alſo the horrible puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that will enſue. Wherefore conſider with your ſelves the end of your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry towards the children of God, towards the Spouſe and Body of Chriſt; and ſee that you never ceaſe your labour, your care and diligence, until you have done all that lieth in you, according to your bounden duty, to bring all ſuch as are, or ſhall be committed to your charge, unto that agreement in the faith and knowledge of God, and to that ripeneſs and perfectneſs of age in Chriſt, that there be no place left among you, either for errour in Religion, or for viciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Life.</p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch then as your Office is both of ſo great excellency, and of ſo great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, ye ſee with how great care and ſtudy ye ought to apply your ſelves, as well that ye may ſhew your ſelves dutiful and thankful unto that Lord who hath placed you in ſo high a Dignity; as alſo to beware, that neither you your ſelves offend, nor be occaſion that others offend. Howbeit ye cannot have a mind and will thereto of your ſelves; for that will and ability is given of God alone: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ought, and have need to pray earneſtly for his holy Spirit. And ſeeing that you cannot by any other means compaſs the doing of ſo weighty a work, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the ſalvation of man, but with doctrine and exhortation taken out of the holy Scriptures, and with a life agreeable to the ſame; conſider how ſtudious, ye ought to be in reading and learning the Scriptures, and in framing the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, both of your ſelves, and of them that ſpecially pertain unto you, according to the rule of the ſame Scriptures: And for this ſelf ſame cauſe, how ye ought to forſake and ſet aſide (as much as you may) all worldly cares and ſtudies.</p>
                  <p>We have good hope that you have well weighed and pondered theſe things with your ſelves long before this time; and that you have clearly determined, by Gods grace, to give your ſelves wholly to this Office, whereunto it hath pleaſed God to call you: So that as much as lieth in you, you will apply your ſelves wholly to this one thing, and draw all your cares and ſtudies this way; and that you will continually pray to God the Father, by the mediation of our only Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, for the heavenly aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt; that by daily reading and weighing of the Scriptures, ye may wax riper and ſtronger in your Miniſtry, and that ye may ſo endeavour your ſelves from time to time, to ſanctifie the lives of you and yours, and to faſhion them after the rule and Doctrine of Chriſt, that ye may be wholſom and godly examples, and patterns for the people to follow.</p>
                  <p>And now that this preſent Congregation of Chriſt, here aſſembled, may alſo underſtand your minds and wills in theſe things, and that this your promiſe may the more move you, to do your duties; ye ſhall anſwer plainly to theſe
<pb facs="tcp:48041:193"/> things, which we in the Name of God, and of his Church, ſhall demand of you touching the ſame.</p>

And when they were come to him, he ſaid unto them, Ye know from the firſt day that I came into Aſia, after what manner I have been with you at all ſeaſons, ſerving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which befel me by the lying in wait of the Jews: And how I kept back no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was profitable unto you, but have ſhewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from houſe to houſe, teſtifying both to the Jews, and alſo to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And now behold, I go bound in the ſpirit unto Jeruſalem, not knowing the things that ſhall befal me there; ſave that the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in every city, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of theſe things move me, neither count I my life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Miniſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Goſpel of the grace of God. And now behold, I know that ye all among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, ſhall ſee my face no more. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the bloud of all men. For I have not ſhunned to declare unto you all the counſel of God. Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto your ſelves, and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own bloud. For I know this, that after my departing, ſhall grievous wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the flock. Alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things, to draw away diſciples after them. Therefore watch, and remember, that by the ſpace of three years I ceaſed not to warn every one night and day with tears. And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the
<pb facs="tcp:48041:195"/> word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are ſanctified. I have coveted no mans ſilver, or gold, or apparel, yea, you your ſelves know, that theſe hands have miniſtred unto my ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and to them that were with me. I have ſhewed you all things, how that ſo labouring ye ought to ſupport the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid, It is more bleſſed to give then to receive.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>BRethren, it is written in the Goſpel of S. Luke, That our Saviour Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued the whole night in Prayer, before he did chooſe and ſend forth his twelve Apoſtles. It is written alſo in the Acts of the Apoſtles, That the Diſciples who
<pb facs="tcp:48041:196"/> were at Antioch, did faſt and pray before they laid hands on Paul and Barnabas, and ſent them forth. Let us therefore, following the example of our Saviour Chriſt and his Apoſtles, firſt fall to prayer, before we admit and ſend forth this Perſon preſented unto us, to the work whereunto we truſt the Holy Ghoſt hath called him.</p>
                  <p>¶ <hi>And then ſhall be ſaid the Litany, as before, in the Form of Ordering Deacons: ſave only that after this place,</hi> That it may pleaſe thee to illuminate all Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c. the proper Suffrage there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſhall be omitted, and this inſerted in ſtead of it;</hi>

                  <p>THat it may pleaſe thee to bleſs this our Brother Elected, and to ſend thy grace upon him, that he may duly execute the Office whereunto he is called, to the edifying of thy Church, and to the honour, praiſe, and glory of thy Name.</p>

                  <p>ALmighty God, giver of all good things, who by thy holy Spirit haſt appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed divers Orders of Miniſters in thy Church; Mercifully behold this thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant now called to the Work and Miniſtry of a Biſhop, and repleniſh him ſo with the truth of thy Doctrine, and adorn him with innocency of life, that both by word and deed he may faithfully ſerve thee in this Office, to the glory of thy Name, and the edifying and well governing of thy Church, through the merits of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghoſt, world without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>ALmighty God, and moſt merciful Father, who of thine infinite goodneſs haſt given thy only and dearly beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt, to be our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and the author of everlaſting life; who after that he had made perfect our Redemption by his death, and was aſcended into heaven, poured down abundantly his gifts upon men, making ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, ſome Paſtors and Doctors, to the edifying and making perfect his Church; Grant, we beſeech thee, to this thy Servant ſuch grace, that he may evermore be ready to ſpread abroad thy Goſpel, the glad tidings of reconciliation with thee, and uſe the Authority given him, not to deſtruction, but to ſalvation; not to hurt, but to help; ſo that as a wiſe and faithful ſervant, giving to thy Family their portion in due ſeaſon, he may at laſt be received into everlaſting joy, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, who with thee and the Holy Ghoſt liveth and reigneth one God, world without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>¶ <hi>Then the Archbiſhop and Biſhops preſent, ſhall lay their Hands upon the Head of the Elected Biſhop, kneeling before them upon his Knees, the Archbiſhop ſaying,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>REceive the Holy Ghoſt, for the Office and Work of a Biſhop in the Church of God, now committed unto thee by the Impoſition of our Hands; In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt. Amen. And remember that thou ſtir up the grace of God which is given thee by this Impoſition of our Hands: For God hath not given us the ſpirit of fear, but of power, and love, and ſoberneſs.</p>
                  <p>¶ <hi>Then the Archbiſhop ſhall deliver him the Bible, ſaying,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>GIve heed unto reading, Exhortation, and Doctrine. Think upon the things contained in this Book. Be diligent in them that the increaſe coming thereby may be manifeſt unto all men. Take heed unto thy ſelf, and to Doctrine, and be diligent in doing them: for by ſo doing thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf, and them that hear thee. Be to the flock of Chriſt a ſhepherd, not a wolf;
<pb facs="tcp:48041:197"/> feed them, devour them not. Hold up the weak, heal the ſick, bind up the broken, bring again the outcaſts, ſeek the loſt. Be ſo merciful, that you be not too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs; ſo miniſter Diſcipline, that you forget not mercy: that when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, you may receive the never-fading crown of glory, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>MOſt merciful Father, we beſeech thee to ſend down upon this thy Servant thy heavenly bleſſing, and ſo endue him with thy holy Spirit, that he Preaching thy Word, may not only be earneſt to reprove, beſeech and rebuke with all patience and doctrine; but alſo may be to ſuch as believe, a wholſom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in word, in converſation, in love, in faith, in chaſtity, and in purity; that faithfully fulfilling his courſe, at the latter day he may receive the crown of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs laid up by the Lord the righteous Judge, who liveth and reigneth one God with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, world without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>PRevent us, O Lord, in all our doings with thy moſt gracious favour, and further us with thy continual help; that in all our works begun, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ended in thee, we may glorifie thy holy Name, and finally by thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy obtain everlaſting life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>ALmighty God, who haſt in all ages ſhewed thy Power and Mercy in the miraculous and gracious deliverances of thy Church, and in the protection of righteous and religious Kings and States, profeſſing thy holy and eternal truth, from the wicked Conſpiracies, and malicious Practices of all the enemies thereof; We yield thee our unfeigned thanks and praiſe, for the wonderful and mighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of our late gracious Sovereign King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, the Queen, the Prince, and all the Royal Branches, with the Nobility, Clergy and Commons of this Realm, then aſſembled in Parliament, by Popiſh Treachery appointed as ſheep to the ſlaughter, in a moſt barbarous and ſavage manner, beyond the examples of former ages. From this unnatural Conſpiracy, not our merit, but thy mercy; not our foreſight, but thy providence delivered us: And therefore not unto us, O Lord, not unto us; but unto thy Name be aſcribed all honour and glory in all Churches of the ſaints, from generation to generation, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ACcept alſo, moſt gracious God, of our unfeigned thanks for filling our hearts again with joy and gladneſs, after the time that thou haſt afflicted us, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a new ſong into our mouths, by bringing his Majeſty, who now reigns over us, upon this Day, for the deliverance of our Church and Nation from Popiſh Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Arbitrary power. We adore the wiſdom and juſtice of thy providence, which ſo timely interpoſed in our extream danger, and diſappointed all the deſigns of our enemies. We beſeech thee, give us ſuch a lively and laſting ſenſe of what thou didſt then, and haſt, ſince that, time done for us, that we may not grow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and careleſs in our obedience, by preſuming upon thy great and undeſerved goddneſs; but that it may lead us to repentance, and move us to be the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and zealous in all the duties of our Religion which thou haſt in a marvellous manner preſerved to us. Let truth and juſtice, brotherly kindneſs and charity, devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and piety, concord and unity, with all other virtues, ſo flouriſh among us, that they may be the Stability of our Times, and make this Church a Praiſe in the Earth. All which we humbly beg for the ſake of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ <hi>In the end of the Litany (which ſhall alway this Day he uſed) after the Collect</hi> [We humbly beſeech thee, O Father, <hi>&amp;c</hi>] <hi>ſhall this be ſaid which followeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALmighty God and heavenly Father, who of thy gracious providence, and tender mercy towards us, didſt prevent the malice and imaginations of our enemies, by diſcovering and confounding their horrible and wicked enterpriſe, plotted and intended this Day to be executed againſt the King, and the whole State of this Realm, for the Subverſion of the Government, and Religion eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among us; and didſt likewiſe upon this Day wonderfully conduct thy ſervant our preſent King, and bring him ſafely into this Kingdom, to preſerve us from the late Attempts of our Enemies, to bereave us of our Religion and Laws: We moſt humbly praiſe and magnifie thy moſt glorious Name, for thy unſpeakable goodneſs towards us expreſſed in both theſe Acts of thy mercy. We confeſs it has been of thy mercy alone, that we are not conſumed: for our ſins have cried to Heaven againſt us; and our iniquities juſtly called for vengeance upon us. But thou haſt not dealt with us after our ſins, nor rewarded us after our iniquities; nor given us over, as we deſerved, to be a prey to our Enemies, but haſt in mercy delivered us from their malice, and preſerved us from death and deſtruction. Let the conſideration of this thy repeated goodneſs, O Lord, work in us true repentance, that iniquity may not be our ruine. And increaſe in us more and more a lively faith and love, fruitful in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedience, that thou mayeſt ſtill continue thy favour with the light of thy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to us and our poſterity for evermore; and that for thy dear Sons ſake Jeſus Chriſt our only Mediatour and Advocate. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>O Lord, who didſt this day diſcover the ſnares of death that were laid for us, and didſt wonderfully deliver us from the ſame; Be thou ſtill our mighty Protectour, and ſcatter our Enemies that delight in blond. Infatuate and defeat their
<pb facs="tcp:48041:199"/> Counſels, abate their Pride, aſſwage their Malice, and confound their Devices. Strengthen the hands of our gracious Sovereign King <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> and all that are put in Authority under him, with Judgment and Juſtice, to cut off all ſuch workers of iniquity, as turn Religion into Rebellion, and Faith into Faction; that they may never prevail againſt us, or triumph in the ruine of thy Church among us: But that our gracious Sovereign and his Realms being preſerved in thy true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by thy merciful goodneſs protected in the ſame, we may all duly ſerve thee, and give thee thanks in thy holy Congregation, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>¶ <hi>In the Communion-Service, inſtead of the Collect for the day, ſhall this which followeth be uſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ETernal God, and our moſt mighty Protectour, we thy unworthy ſervants do humbly preſent our ſelves before thy Majeſty, acknowledging thy Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs in Preſerving the King, and the Three Eſtates of this Realm aſſembled in Parliament, from the Deſtruction this Day intended againſt them. Make us, we beſeech thee, truly thankful for this, and for all other thy great Mercies towards us; particularly for making this Day again memorable, by a freſh Inſtance of thy Loving-kindneſs towards us. We bleſs thee for giving his Majeſty, that now is, a ſafe Arrival here, and for making all Oppoſition fall before him, till he became our King and Governour. Continue, we beſeech thee, to Protect and Defend him, and all the Royal Family, from all Treaſons and Conſpiracies; Preſerve them in thy Faith, Fear and Love; Proſper his Reign with long Happineſs here on Earth; and Crown him with everlaſting Glory hereafter, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour and Redeemer. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>O Moſt mighty God, terrible in thy judgments, and wonderful in thy doings toward the children of men; who in thy heavy diſpleaſure didſt ſuffer the life of our late gracious Sovereign King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt to be (as) this day taken away by the hands of cruel and bloudy men: We thy ſinful creatures here aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before thee, do, in the behalf of all the people of this land, humbly confeſs, that they were the crying fins if this Nation, which brought down this heavy judgment upon us. But, O gracious God, when thou makeſt inquiſition for bloud, lay not the guilt of this innocent bloud (the ſhedding whereof nothing but the bloud of thy Son can expiate) lay it not to the charge of the people of this land; nor let it ever be required of us, or our poſterity. Be merciful, O Lord, be merciful unto thy
<pb facs="tcp:48041:201"/> people, whom thou haſt redeemed; and be not angry with us for ever: But pardon us for thy mercies ſake, through the merits of thy Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BLeſſed Lord, in whoſe fight the death of thy ſaints is precious; We magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thy Name for thine abundant grace beſtowed on our late martyr'd So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign; by which he was enabled ſo cheerfully to follow the ſteps of his bleſſed Maſter and Saviour, in a conſtant meek ſuffering of all barbarous indignities, and at laſt reſiſting unto bloud; and even then according to the ſame pattern, praying for his murderers. Let his memory, O Lord, be ever bleſſed among us; that we may follow the example of his courage and conſtancy, his meekneſs, and patience, and great charity. And grant, that this our land may be freed from the vengeance of his righteous bloud, and thy mercy glorified in the forgiveneſs of our ſins; and all for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake our only Mediatour and Advocate. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>¶ <hi>In the end of the Litany (which ſhall always on this day be uſed) immediately after the Collect,</hi> [We humbly beſeech thee, O Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] <hi>the three Collects next following are to be read.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>O Moſt mighty God, and merciful Father, who haſt compaſſion upon all men, and hateſt nothing that thou haſt made, who wouldeſt not the death of a ſinner, but that he ſhould rather turn from his ſin and be ſaved; Mercifully forgive us our treſpaſſes; receive and comfort us, who are grieved and wearied with the burden of our ſins. Thy property is always to have mercy; to thee only it appertaineth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſins. Spare us therefore, good Lord, ſpare thy people, whom thou haſt redeemed; enter not into judgment with thy ſervants, who are vile earth and miſerable ſinners; but ſo turn thine anger from us, who meekly acknowledge our vileneſs, and truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent us of our faults; and ſo make haſte to help us in this world, that we may ever live with thee in the world to come, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TUrn thou us, O good Lord, and ſo ſhall we be turned. Be favourable, O Lord, Be favourable to thy people, Who turn to thee in weeping, faſting, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For thou art a merciful God, Full of Compaſſion, Long-ſuffering, and of great pity. Thou ſpareſt, when we deſerve puniſhment, And in thy wrath thinkeſt upon mercy. Spare thy people, good Lord, ſpare them, and let not thine heritage be brought to confuſion. Hear us, O Lord, for thy mercy is great, And after the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thy mercies look upon us, Through the merits and mediation of thy bleſſed Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

For ſo is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men: As free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloke of maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervants of God. Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God Honour the King. Servants be ſubject to your maſters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward. For what is thank-worthy, if a man for conſcience toward God endure grief, ſuffering wrongfully. For what glory is it, if when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye ſhall take it patiently? but if when ye do well, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for it, ye take it patiently; this is acceptable with God.

               <p>O Bleſſed Lord God, who by thy wiſdom not only guideſt, and ordereſt all things moſt ſuitably to thine own juſtice; but alſo performeſt thy pleaſure in ſuch a manner, that we cannot but acknowledge thee to be righteous in all thy ways, and holy in all thy works: We thy ſinful people do here fall down before thee, confeſſing that thy judgments were right, in permitting cruel men, ſons of Belial, as this day, to imbrue their hands in the bloud of thine Anointed; we having drawn down the ſame upon our ſelves, by the great and long provocations of our ſins againſt thee. For which we do therefore here humble our ſelves before thee; imploring thy mercy for the pardon of them all; and that thou wouldſt deliver this Nation from bloud-guiltineſs, (that of this day eſpecially) and turn from us and our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity all thoſe judgments which we by our ſins have deſerved: Grant this for the all-ſufficient merits of thy Son our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BLeſſed God, juſt and powerful, who didſt permit thy dear Servant, our late dread Sovereign King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, to be, as upon this day, given up to the violent outrages of wicked men, to be deſpitefully uſed, and at laſt murdered by them: Though we cannot reflect upon ſo foul an act, but with horrour and aſtoniſhment; yet do we moſt gratefully commemorate the glories of thy grace which then ſhined forth in thine Anointed; whom thou wert pleas'd even at the hour of death to endue with an eminent meaſure of exemplary patience, meekneſs, and charity, before the face of his cruel enemies. And albeit thou didſt ſuffer them to proceed to ſuch an height of violence, as to kill him, and to take poſſeſſion of his Throne; yet didſt thou in great mercy preſerve his Son, whoſe right it was, and at length by a wonderful providence bring him back, and ſet him thereon, to reſtore thy true Religion, and to ſettle peace amongſt us: For which we glorifie thy Name, through Jeſus Chriſt our bleſſed Saviour. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>ALmighty and everlaſting God, whoſe righteouſneſs is like the ſtrong moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and thy judgments like the great deep; and who by that barbarous murder, as upon this day committed upon the Sacred Perſon of thine Anointed, haſt taught us, that neither the greateſt of Kings, nor the beſt of men are more ſecure from violence then from natural death; Teach us alſo hereby ſo to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wiſdom. And grant that neither the ſplendour of any thing that is great, nor the conceit of any thing that is good in us, may any ways withdraw our eyes from looking upon our ſelves as ſinful duſt and aſhes; but that according to the example of this thy bleſſed Martyr, we may preſs forward toward the prize of the high calling that is before us, in faith and patience, humility and meekneſs, mortification and ſelf-denial, charity and conſtant perſeverance unto the end; And all this for thy Son our Lord Jeſus Chriſt his ſake: To whom with thee and the holy Ghoſt, be all honour and glory, world without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Submit your ſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lords ſake: whether it be to the king, as ſupreme; or unto governours, as unto them that are ſent by him for the puniſhment of evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well. For ſo is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men: as free, and not uſing your liberty for a cloke of maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervants of God. Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</p>

               <head>The Goſpel. <hi>S. Matth.</hi> 22.16.</head>
               <p>ANd they ſent out unto him their diſciples, with the Herodians, ſaying, Maſter, we know that thou art true, and teacheſt the way of God in truth, neither careſt thou for any man: for thou regardeſt not the perſon of men. Tell us therefore, What thinkeſt thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Ceſar, or not? But Jeſus perceived their wickedneſs, and ſaid, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? Shew me the tribute-money. And they brought unto him a peny. And he ſaith unto them, Whoſe is this image and ſuperſcription? They ſay unto him, Ceſars. Then ſaith he unto them, Render there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, unto Ceſar, the things which are Ceſars: and unto God, the things that are Gods. When they had heard theſe words, they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</p>

               <p>Not every one that ſaith unto me Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of heaven; but he that doth the will of my Father which is in heaven. S. <hi>Math.</hi> 7.21.</p>
               <p>¶ <hi>After the Prayer</hi> [For the whole ſtate of Chriſts Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] <hi>this collect following shall be used.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ALmighty God and heavenly Father, who of thine infinite and unſpeakable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards us didſt in a moſt extraordinary and wonderful manner diſappoint and overthrow the wicked Deſigns of thoſe traiterous, heady and high-minded men, who under the pretence of Religion, and thy moſt holy Name, had contrived, and well nigh effected the utter deſtruction of this Church and Kingdom: As we do this day moſt heartily and devoutly adore and magnifie thy glorious Name for this thine infinite gracious goodneſs already vouchſafed to us; ſo we moſt humbly beſeech thee to continue thy grace and favour towards us, hiding and covering us under the ſhadow of thy wings, that no ſuch diſmal calamity may ever again fall upon us. To this end ſend forth thy light and thy truth, for the diſcovery of theſe depths of Satan, this myſtery of iniquity. Infatuate and defeat all the ſecret counſels of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. Abate their pride, aſſwage their malice, and confound their devices. Strengthen the hands of our gracious Sovereign King <hi>William,</hi> and all that are put in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity under him, with judgment and juſtice, to cut off all ſuch workers of iniquity as turn Religion into Rebellion, and Faith into Faction; that they may never again prevail againſt us, nor triumph in the ruine of the Monarchy and thy Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. Protect and defend our Sovereign Lord the King, with the whole Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family, from all Treaſons and Conſpiracies. Be unto him an helmet of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a ſtrong tower of defence againſt the face of all his enemies. As for thoſe that are implacable, clothe them with ſhame and confuſion, but upon himſelf and his poſterity let the Crown for ever flouriſh. So we that are thy people and the ſheep of thy paſture ſhall give thee thanks for ever, and will always be ſhewing forth thy praiſe from generation to generation, through Jeſus Chriſt our only Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Redeemer; to whom with thee, O Father, and God the Holy Ghoſt, be glory in the Church throughout all ages, world without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>
